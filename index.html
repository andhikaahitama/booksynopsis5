<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Introducing Social Semiotics</h2><p><em>Introducing Social Semiotics </em>uses a wide variety of texts including photographs, adverts, magazine pages and film stills to explain how meaning is created through complex semiotic interactions. Practical exercises and examples as wide ranging as furniture arrangements in public places and&nbsp;advertising jingles, provide readers with the knowledge and skills they need to be able to analyze and also produce successful multimodal texts and designs.<br>The book traces the development of semiotic resources through particular channels such as the history of the Press and advertising; and explores how and why these resources change over time, for reasons such as advancing technology.<br>Featuring a full glossary of terms, exercises, discussion points and suggestions for further reading, <em>Introducing Social Semiotics </em>makes concrete the complexities of meaning making and is essential reading for anyone interested in how communication works.</p><p>Theo van Leeuwen is one of the biggest names in communication and language research and his work always generates a lot of interest. He has extensive experience working in TV and film in Holland and Australia, and is now Chair of the Centre for Language &amp; Communication Research at Cardiff University.</p><h2>Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry</h2><p><p>Descartes has often been called the 'father of modern philosophy'.His attempts to find foundations for knowledge, and to reconcile the existence of the soul with the emerging science of his time, are among the most influential and widely studied in the history of philosophy.</p> <p>This is a classic and challenging introduction to Descartes by one of the most distinguished modern philosophers. Bernard Williams not only analyzes Descartes' project of founding knowledge on certainty, but uncovers the philosophical motives for his search. With acute insight, he demonstrates how Descartes' <em>Meditations </em>are not merely a description but the very enactment of philosophical thought and discovery. Williams covers all of the key areas of Descartes' thought, including God, the will, the possibility of knowledge, and the mind and its place in nature. He also makes profound contributions to the theory of knowledge, metaphysics and philosophy generally. This is essential reading for any student of philosophy.</p> <p>This reissue includes a new foreword by John Cottingham.</p></p><p><p><strong>Bernard Williams</strong> died in 2003. He taught at the Universities of London, Cambridge, Oxford and the University of California at Berkeley, and was one of the leading philosophers of his generation. He wrote many influential books including <em>Problems of the Self</em> and Ethics and the <em>Limits of Philosophy</em>.

It is itself a work of substantive philosophical analysis and a reminder of just what British philosophy lost when Williams died in 2003.'</strong> - <em>New Humanist</em></p> <p><strong>'[Bernard Williams] brought philosophical reflection to an opulent array of subjects, with more imagination and with greater cultural and historical understanding than anyone else of his time'</strong> <em>Thomas Nagel, London Review of Books</em></p> <p><strong>'Bernard Williams has a greater force of thought, deployed over a wider horizon, than anyone else I have ever listened to.</strong>' <em>John Dunn - The Times Higher Education Supplement</em></p></p><h2>Atlas of Human Parasitology</h2><p>Univ. of California, Los Angeles. Comprehensive guide for the identification and diagnosis of human parasites. Color illustrations. DNLM: Parasites--Atlases.</p><p>This is an excellent resource for those diagnosing parasitic infections and those teaching parasitology to medical students or medical technologists. The variety of color photographs gives the reader a truer perspective of what the organism may look like under the microscope. This is a comprehensive guide to human parasites and artifacts that resemble organisms. Other books on parasitology limit their contents to wordy explanations and black-and-white illustrations, whereas this atlas demonstrates that one color picture is worth one thousand words. --Roberta Carey, PhD -- Doody&#39;s Review Service �</p><h2>250 Poems: A Portable Anthology</h2><p><br><br><i>250 Poems </i>offers a wide and well-balanced selection of chronologically arranged poems, supported by succinct, practical editorial features, at a great price. <p></p><p></p>This volume in Bedford/St. Martin&#x2019;s popular series of Portable Anthologies and Portable Guides offers the series&#x2019; trademark combination of high quality and great value for teachers of literature and their cost-conscious students.<br><br></p><p><br><br>Peter Schakel is Peter C. and Emajean Cook Professor of English at Hope College.

Writing for a broad audience, Mark Bertness examines how distinctive communities of plants and animals are generated on rocky shores and in salt marshes, mangroves, and soft sediment beaches on Atlantic shorelines.</p><br><p> The book provides a comprehensive background for understanding the basic principles of intertidal ecology and the unique conditions faced by intertidal organisms. It describes the history of the Atlantic Coast, tides, and near-shore oceanographic processes that influence shoreline organisms; explains primary production in shoreline systems, intertidal food webs, and the way intertidal organisms survive; sets out the unusual reproductive challenges of living in an intertidal habitat, and the role of recruitment in shaping intertidal communities; and outlines how biological processes like competition, predation, facilitation, and ecosystem engineering generate the spatial structure of intertidal communities.</p><br><p> The last part of the book focuses on the ecology of the three main shoreline habitats--rocky shores, soft sediment beaches, and shorelines vegetated with salt marsh plants and mangroves--and discusses in detail conservation issues associated with each of them.</p></p><p><b>Mark D. Bertness</b> is Robert P. Brown Professor of Biology and Chair of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University."A definite seashore man at heart, Bertness has produced a wonderful general introduction and field guide to the ecology of shoreline communities of the North American coast. . . . Hopefully, another thoughtful book such as this one will be on the horizon." (<i>Biology Digest</i>)<br><br>"This book is not another field guide to the seashore. Instead, it is a general introduction to the ecology of the Atlantic coast of North America with its predominance of rocky shores in the north and extensive salt marshes in the south. Although written primarily for students, I wish to recommend this excellent book also to investigators of other environments which have strong gradients such as from dry to wet land or the slope of high mountains."<b>---Karsten Reise, <i>Basic and Applied Ecology</i></b><br><br>"The reader will discover many new examples not contained in less recent volumes, even if they are not working on North American Atlantic shorelines. As someone who has a life-long interest in this general area I am pleased to have it on my library shelf."<b>---Dave Raffaelli, <i>Fish and Fisheries</i></b><br><br>"The volume is clearly written and very well referenced.... The book will be an excellent reference for students and anyone interested in shoreline environments and who wants to understand the organization and processes that govern intertidal systems."<b>---Larry G. Harris, <i>Quarterly Review of Biology</i></b><br><br>"<i>Atlantic Shorelines</i> is an easily readable introduction to coastal ecology, aimed at undergraduate students as well as a broader interest public. It avoids, as much as possible, jargon and mathematical formulas, and modeling is absent as well."<b>---Gerhard C. Cad�e, <i>Aquatic Ecology</i></b><br><br>"<i>Atlantic Shorelines</i> is fairly technical and aimed at a college audience but is of interest to anyone who wants a greater understanding of our nearby Atlantic shoreline." (<i>Wildlife Activist</i>)<br><br>"Praise for Mark Bertness's <i>Ecology of Atlantic Shorelines</i>: "[T]he major strength of this book is Bertness' ability to present important concepts and ideas in a conversational text, one which should be engaging to students. I think he does an excellent job in pulling together many fields of study (geology, hydrology, and ecology) in a way that shows the interconnectedness of these fields on the Atlantic shorelines.""<b>---Mary Crowe, <i>Ecology</i></b></p><h2>Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You</h2><p>Does what's on your desk reveal what's on your mind? Do those pictures on your walls tell true tales about you? And is your favorite outfit about to give you away? For the last ten years psychologist Sam Gosling has been studying how people project (and protect) their inner selves. By exploring our private worlds (desks, bedrooms, even our clothes and our cars), he shows not only how we showcase our personalities in unexpected-and unplanned-ways, but also how we create personality in the first place, communicate it others, and interpret the world around us. Gosling, one of the field's most innovative researchers, dispatches teams of scientific snoops to poke around dorm rooms and offices, to see what can be learned about people simply from looking at their stuff. What he has discovered is astonishing: when it comes to the most essential components of our personalities-from friendliness to flexibility-the things we own and the way we arrange them often say more about us than even our most intimate conversations. If you know what to look for, you can figure out how reliable a new boyfriend is by peeking into his medicine cabinet or whether an employee is committed to her job by analyzing her cubicle. Bottom line: The insights we gain can boost our understanding of ourselves and sharpen our perceptions of others. Packed with original research and fascinating stories, <i>Snoop</i> is a captivating guidebook to our not-so-secret lives.</p><p><b>Sam Gosling</b> is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. He has spent the last decade conducting research on how personality is expressed and perceived in everyday contexts. He has been profiled by the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Psychology Today</i>, and other publications, and he is featured in Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Blink</i>. This is his first book. He lives in Austin, Texas.<p> Reviewed by Jay Dixit</p><p></p><p> In 1942, as the United States was entering World War II, the Office of Strategic Services -- the precursor to today's CIA -- was scrambling to find promising spies to go behind enemy lines. One of the aptitude exams it developed was the Belongings Test, in which candidates had to draw conclusions about a man based purely on items in his bedroom: clothes, a timetable, a ticket receipt. </p><p></p><p> Sam Gosling, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, has made a career of studying how such clues illuminate personality. His premise is that our personalities seep out in everything we do and that expert snoopers can draw remarkably accurate pictures of us by examining the traces we leave behind. </p><p></p><p>Gosling's conclusions are supported by rigorous academic research, but his engaging book is aimed at a popular audience; he presents it as a field guide to the "special brand of voyeurism" he calls "snoopology." Few readers may actually rummage through their neighbors' garbage in search of what Gosling dryly calls "behavioral residue," but Snoop's conceit makes for an entertaining tour of how people project their inner selves outward into the world.</p><p></p><p>Some clues come from explicit, deliberate identity claims, like the Malcolm X poster on your wall or the crucifix over your bed. Others, like the songs you download or the coffee cup you throw away, are what psychologists call "seepage," messages that leak out beneath your notice. </p><p></p><p>The trick to decoding a person's space is knowing what to look for. Offices with plants, knick-knacks and symbols of friends, family and pets tend to belong to women; men display more sports items and symbols of their achievements. Rock fans are less friendly, more artistic and more anxious than fans of religious music. Extroverts offer comfortable chairs and bowls of candy as "bait" to lure people into their offices, while difficult people wind up on the remote fringes of the workplace.</p><p>This may seem like just common sense, but it's not. We think people with messy, disorganized bedrooms will be unpleasant, but we're wrong. We incorrectly assume people whose rooms are highly decorated and cluttered are more extroverted. We make similar errors in judging people directly: We expect timid, grumpy-looking people with weak voices and halting speech to be anxious and easily upset, and we expect self-assured, smiling, stylish people to be open, imaginative and curious. But neither expectation is accurate.</p><p></p><p>On a date or job interview, you may succeed in presenting a misleading impression of yourself. But since the gradual accumulation of clues in your living space is hard to fake, snooping can yield a penetrating portrait. And that, says Gosling, is perfectly okay, because though we try to put our best selves forward, most of us, in the end, want to be known not for who we wish we could be, but for who we are.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one of the main ways we carve out our identity is by consuming. We surround ourselves with things that reinforce our conception of who we are, purchasing not just the objects we need but also symbols that help us articulate our personal narratives. That's why Ramones T-shirts outsell Ramones albums 10 to one and why, Rob Walker asserts, 75 percent of Viking's ultra-high-end kitchen ranges are never used. </p><p></p><p> In Buying In, Walker, who writes a consumer behavior column for the New York Times Magazine, makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. True, we've grown skeptical of traditional advertising, the clumsy, crass kind in which someone on Madison Avenue thinks up a soft-drink jingle and broadcasts it into ubiquity. And it's true that TiVo and the Internet have given us more control over the advertisements we see. </p><p> But Walker leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. Consider the iconic mouthless cat known as Hello Kitty, used for marketing clothes, toys and bandages by the Japanese company Sanrio. She has no personality because the company painstakingly avoids defining her character, Walker says. The key to the mega-brand's success, he suggests, is ensuring that Hello Kitty remains an ambiguous symbol, a blank slate on which buyers can inscribe whatever meaning they want, from nostalgia to camp to subversiveness. </p><p></p><p>For the same reason, the makers of Red Bull never claim anything specific about the highly caffeinated drink's special ingredient, taurine, or which powers of athleticism, mental acuity or virility it supposedly bestows. They prefer marketing campaigns that promote the brand's "personality" by sponsoring such extreme sporting events as kiteboarding to Cuba, kayaking over waterfalls and street luge.</p><p>Or consider how the Pabst Blue Ribbon brand was hijacked by young, anti-corporate types. PBR's fan base grew not from aggressive marketing, Walker says, but from the lack of it. Long neglected, PBR had virtually no image at all, which helped make it an underground darling among people who attached a blue-collar, honest-workingman, anti-capitalist ethos to the brand.</p><p></p><p> Walker's analysis breaks down in places. He can't fathom why people would pay more for a Viking range or an iPod when competing products are cheaper. Most iPod buyers have never heard of such features as "Smart Playlists" and thus, he concludes, do not understand "all the functions that they paid a premium to obtain" -- as if those functions, and not the device's sleek form, are what drew 100 million purchasers. He considers the notion that people can pay for aesthetic pleasure but then dismisses it, saying it sounds more like a "rationale" than a rational choice. He's likewise baffled by why anyone would buy Method's leaky but beautiful, hourglass-shaped bottle of dish soap. Since we don't parade around town impressing others with elegant cleaning products, there's no "purely rational defense" for buying one, he says, seemingly oblivious to the possibility that we can rationally spend money on aesthetic pleasures we will enjoy alone.</p><p></p><p>But his major argument is convincing: In this new era of participatory marketing, many brands' meanings -- once crafted and maintained from atop the peaks of corporate hierarchies -- now originate from consumers. We once feared an Orwellian future in which big, scary corporations secretly manipulated our thoughts and desires. But commercial influence has become an open-source project. "We have already met the new hidden persuaders," writes Walker, "and they are us." </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Tremendous in scope, breathtaking in its suspense, &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34; stretches the boundaries further than any book you have ever read. It is a mystery, not about the murder of a man&#39;s body, but about the murder - and rebirth - of man&#39;s spirit.</p><p>Ayn Rand (1905-1982) is best known for her philosophy of Objectivism and her novels We the Living, Anthem, The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ayn Rand held that art is a &#x201c;re-creation of reality according to an artist&#x2019;s metaphysical value judgments.&#x201d; By its nature, therefore, a novel (like a statue or a symphony) does not require or tolerate an explanatory preface; it is a self-contained universe, aloof from commentary, beckoning the reader to enter, perceive, respond.</p><p>Ayn Rand would never have approved of a didactic (or laudatory) introduction to her book, and I have no intention of flouting her wishes. Instead, I am going to give her the floor. I am going to let you in on some of the thinking she did as she was preparing to write &nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i></p><p>Before starting a novel, Ayn Rand wrote voluminously in her journals about its theme, plot, and characters. She wrote not for any audience, but strictly for herself&#x2014;that is, for the clarity of her own understanding. The journals dealing with&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged</i>&nbsp;are powerful examples of her mind in action, confident even when groping, purposeful even when stymied, luminously eloquent even though wholly unedited. These journals are also a fascinating record of the step-by-step birth of an immortal work of art.</p><p>In due course, all of Ayn Rand&#x2019;s writings will be published. For this 35th anniversary edition of&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>however, I have selected, as a kind of advance bonus for her fans, four typical journal entries. Let me warn new readers that the passages reveal the plot and will spoil the book for anyone who reads them before knowing the story.</p><p>As I recall, &#x201c;Atlas Shrugged&#x201d; did not become the novel&#x2019;s title until Miss Rand&#x2019;s husband made the suggestion in 1956. The working title throughout the writing was &#x201c;The Strike.&#x201d;</p><p>The earliest of Miss Rand&#x2019;s notes for &#x201c;The Strike&#x201d; are dated January 1, 1945, about a year after the publication of<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally enough, the subject on her mind was how to differentiate the present novel from its predecessor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Theme</i>. What happens to the world when the Prime Movers go on strike.</p><p>This means&#x2014;a picture of the world with its motor cut off. Show: what, how, why. The specific steps and incidents&#x2014;in terms of persons, their spirits, motives, psychology and actions&#x2014;and, &nbsp;secondarily, proceeding from persons, in terms of history, society and the world.</p><p>The theme requires: to show who are the prime movers and why, how they function. Who are their enemies and why, what are the motives behind the hatred for and the enslavement of the prime movers; the nature of the obstacles placed in their way, and the reasons for it.</p><p>This last paragraph is contained entirely in&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Roark and Toohey are the complete statement of it. Therefore, this is not the direct theme of&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&#x2014;but it is part of the theme and must be kept in mind, stated again (though briefly) to have the theme clear and complete.</p><p>First question to decide is on whom the emphasis must be placed&#x2014;on the prime movers, the parasites or the world. The answer is:&nbsp;<i>The world.</i>&nbsp;The story must be primarily a picture of the whole.</p><p>In this sense,&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&nbsp;is to be much more a &#x201c;social&#x201d; novel than&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead. The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;was about &#x201c;individualism and collectivism within man&#x2019;s soul&#x201d;; it showed the nature and function of the creator and the second-hander. The primary concern there was with Roark and Toohey&#x2014;showing &nbsp;<i>what they are</i>. The rest of the characters were variations of the theme of the relation of the ego to others&#x2014;mixtures of the two extremes, the two poles: Roark and Toohey. The primary concern of the story was the characters, the people as such&#x2014;their&nbsp;<i>natures</i>. Their relations to each other&#x2014;which is society, men in relation to men&#x2014;were secondary, an unavoidable, direct consequence of Roark set against Toohey. But it was not the theme.</p><p>Now, it is this&nbsp;<i>relation</i>&nbsp;that must be the theme. Therefore, the personal becomes secondary. That is, the personal is necessary only to the extent needed to make the relationships clear. In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I showed that Roark moves the world&#x2014;that the Keatings feed upon him and hate him for it, while the Tooheys are out consciously to destroy him. But the theme was Roark&#x2014;not Roark&#x2019;s relation to the world. Now it will be the relation.</p><p>In other words, I must show in what concrete, specific way the world is moved by the creators. Exactly&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;do the second-handers live on the creators. Both in&nbsp;<i>spiritual</i>&nbsp;matters&#x2014;and (most particularly) in concrete, physical events. (Concentrate on the concrete, physical events&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t forget to keep in mind at all times how the physical proceeds from the spiritual.) . . .</p><p>However, for the purpose of this story, I do not start by showing&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;the second-handers live on the prime movers in actual, everyday reality&#x2014;nor do I start by showing a normal world. (That comes in only in necessary retrospect, or flashback, or by implication in the events themselves.) I start with &nbsp;<i>the fantastic premise of the prime movers going on strike.</i>&nbsp;This is the actual heart and center of the novel. A distinction carefully &nbsp;to be observed here: I do not set out to glorify the prime mover (<i>that was The Fountainhead</i>). I set out to show how desperately the world needs prime movers, and how viciously it treats them. And I show it on a hypothetical case&#x2014;<i>what happens to the world without them.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I did not show how desperately the world needed Roark&#x2014;except by implication. I did show how viciously the world treated him, and why. I showed&nbsp;<i>mainly what he is.</i>&nbsp;It was Roark&#x2019;s story. This must be the world&#x2019;s story&#x2014;in relation to its prime movers. (Almost&#x2014;the story of a body in relation to its heart&#x2014;a body dying of anemia.)</p><p>I don&#x2019;t show directly what the prime movers do&#x2014;that&#x2019;s shown only by implication. I&nbsp;<i>show what happens when they don&#x2019;t do it.</i>&nbsp;(Through that, you see the picture of what they do, their place and their role.) (This is an important guide for the construction of the story.)</p><p>In order to work out the story, Ayn Rand had to understand fully why the prime movers&nbsp;<i>allowed</i>&nbsp;the second-handers to live on them&#x2014;why the creators had not gone on strike throughout history&#x2014;what errors even the best of them made that kept them in thrall to the worst. Part of the answer is dramatized in the character of Dagny Taggart, the railroad heiress who declares war on the strikers. Here is a note on her psychology, dated April 18, 1946:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her error&#x2014;and the cause of her refusal to join the strike&#x2014;is over-optimism and over-confidence (particularly this last). Over-optimism&#x2014;in that she thinks men are better than they are, she doesn&#x2019;t really understand them and is generous about it.</p><p>Over-confidence&#x2014;in that she thinks she can do more than an individual actually can. She thinks she can run a railroad (or the world) single-handed, she can make people do what she wants or needs, what is right, by the sheer force of her own talent; not by&nbsp;<i>forcing</i>&nbsp;them, of course, not by enslaving them and giving orders&#x2014;but by the sheer over-abundance of her own energy; she will show them how, she can teach them and persuade them, she is so able that they&#x2019;ll catch it from her. (This is still faith in their rationality, in the omnipotence of reason. The mistake? Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot be conquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone.)</p><p>On these two points, Dagny is committing an important (but excusable and understandable) error in thinking, the kind of error individualists and creators often make. It is an error proceeding from the best in their nature and from a proper principle, but this principle is misapplied. . . .</p><p>The error is this: it is proper for a creator to be optimistic, in the deepest, most basic sense, since the creator believes in a benevolent universe and functions on that premise. But it is an error to extend that optimism to other&nbsp;<i>specific</i>men. First, &nbsp;it&#x2019;s not necessary, the creator&#x2019;s life and the nature of the universe do not require it, his life does not depend on others. Second, man is a being with free will; therefore, each man is potentially good or evil, and it&#x2019;s up to him and only to him (through his reasoning mind) to decide which he wants to be. The decision will affect only him; it is not (and cannot and should not be) the primary concern of any other human being.</p><p>Therefore, while a creator does and must worship&nbsp;<i>Man</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which means his own highest potentiality; which is his natural self-reverence), he must not make the mistake of thinking that this means the necessity to worship&nbsp;<i>Mankind</i>(as a collective). These are two entirely different conceptions, with entirely&#x2014;(immensely and diametrically opposed)&#x2014;different consequences.</p><p>Man, at his highest potentiality, is realized and fulfilled within each creator himself. . . .Whether the creator is alone, or finds only a handful of others like him, or is among the majority of mankind, is of no importance or consequence whatever; numbers have nothing to do with it. He alone or he and a few others like him&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;mankind, in the proper sense of being the proof of what man actually is, man at his best, the essential man, man at his highest possibility. (The&nbsp;<i>rational</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;being, who acts according to his nature.)</p><p>It should not matter to a creator whether anyone or a million or&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;the men around him fall short of the ideal of Man; let him live up to that ideal himself; this is all the &#x201c;optimism&#x201d; about Man that he needs. But this is a hard and subtle thing to realize&#x2014;and it would be natural for Dagny always to make the mistake of believing others are better than they really are (or will become better, or she will teach them to become better or, actually, she so desperately&nbsp;<i>wants</i>them to be better)&#x2014;and to be tied to the world by that hope.</p><p>It is proper for a creator to have an unlimited confidence in himself and his ability, to feel certain that he can get anything he wishes out of life, that he can accomplish anything he decides to accomplish, and that it&#x2019;s up to him to do it. (He feels it because he is a man of reason . . .) [But] here is what he must keep clearly in mind: it is true that a creator can accomplish anything he wishes&#x2014;if he functions according to the nature of man, the universe and his own proper morality, that is, if he does not place his wish primarily within others and does not attempt or desire anything that is of a collective nature, anything that concerns others&nbsp;<i>primarily</i>&nbsp;or requires primarily the exercise of the will of others. (This would be an &nbsp;<i>immoral</i>&nbsp;desire or attempt, contrary to his nature as a creator.) If he attempts that, he is out of a creator&#x2019;s province and in that of the collectivist and the second-hander.</p><p>Therefore, he must never feel confident that he can do anything whatever to, by or through others. (He can&#x2019;t&#x2014;and he shouldn&#x2019;t even wish to try it&#x2014;and the mere attempt is improper.) He must not think that he can . . . somehow transfer his energy and his intelligence to them and make them fit for &nbsp;his purposes in that way. He must face other men as they are, recognizing them as essentially independent entities, by nature, and beyond his&nbsp;<i>primary</i>&nbsp;influence; [he must] deal with them only on his own, independent terms, deal with such as he judges can fit his purpose or live up to his standards (by themselves and of their own will, independently of him) and expect nothing from the others. . . .</p><p>Now, in Dagny&#x2019;s case, her desperate desire is to run Taggart Transcontinental. She sees that there are no men suited to her purpose around her, no men of ability, independence and competence. She thinks she can run it with others, with the incompetent and the parasites, either by training them or merely by treating them as robots who will take her orders and function without personal initiative or responsibility;&nbsp;<i>with herself, in effect, being the spark of initiative, the bearer of responsibility for a whole collective.</i>&nbsp;This can&#x2019;t be done. This is her crucial error.</p><p>This is where she fails.</p><p>Ayn Rand&#x2019;s basic purpose as a novelist was to present not villains or even heroes with errors, but the ideal man&#x2014;the consistent, the fully integrated, the perfect. In&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>&nbsp;this is John Galt, the towering figure who moves the world and the novel, yet does not appear onstage until Part III. By his nature (and that of the story) Galt is necessarily central to the lives of all the characters. In one note, &#x201c;Galt&#x2019;s relation to the others,&#x201d; dated June 27, 1946, Miss Rand defines succinctly what Galt represents to each of them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>For Dagny</i>&#x2014;the ideal. The answer to her two quests: the man of genius and the man she loves. The first quest is expressed in her search for the inventor of the engine. The second&#x2014;her growing conviction that she will never be in love . . .</p><p><i>For Rearden</i>&#x2014;the friend. The kind of understanding and appreciation he has always wanted and did not know he wanted (or he thought he had it&#x2014;he tried to find it in those around him, to get it from his wife, his mother, brother and sister).</p><p><i>For Francisco d&#x2019;Anconia</i>&#x2014;the aristocrat. The only man who represents a challenge and a stimulant&#x2014;almost the &#x201c;proper kind&#x201d; of audience, worthy of stunning for the sheer joy and color of life.</p><p><i>For Danneskj�ld</i>&#x2014;the anchor. The only man who represents land and roots to a restless, reckless wanderer, like the goal of a struggle, the port at the end of a fierce sea-voyage&#x2014;the only man he can respect.</p><p><i>For the Composer</i>&#x2014;the inspiration and the perfect audience.</p><p><i>For the Philosopher</i>&#x2014;the embodiment of his abstractions.</p><p><i>For Father Amadeus</i>&#x2014;the source of his conflict. The uneasy realization that Galt is the end&nbsp;<i>of</i>&nbsp;his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man&#x2014;and that his means do not fit this end (and that he is destroying this, his ideal, for the sake of those who are evil).</p><p><i>To James Taggart</i>&#x2014;the eternal threat. The secret dread. The reproach. The guilt (his own guilt). He has no specific tie-in with Galt&#x2014;but he has that constant, causeless, unnamed, hysterical fear. And he recognizes it when he hears Galt&#x2019;s broadcast and when he sees Galt in person for the first time.</p><p><i>To the Professor</i>&#x2014;his conscience. The reproach and reminder. The ghost that haunts him through everything he does, without a moment&#x2019;s peace. The thing that says:&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;No&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;to his whole life.</p><p>Some notes on the above: Rearden&#x2019;s sister, Stacy, was a minor character later cut from the novel.</p><p>&#x201c;Francisco&#x201d; was spelled &#x201c;Francesco&#x201d; in these early years, while Danneskj�ld&#x2019;s first name at this point was Ivar, presumably after Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish &#x201c;match king,&#x201d; who was the real-life model of Bjorn Faulkner in&nbsp;<i>Night of January 16th.</i></p><p>Father Amadeus was Taggart&#x2019;s priest, to whom he confessed his sins. The priest was supposed to be a positive character, honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the morality of mercy. Miss Rand dropped him, she told me, when she found that it was impossible to make such a character convincing.</p><p>The Professor is Robert Stadler.</p></p><h2>German Grammar (Barron&#39;s Grammar Series)</h2><p>The new German Grammar--a smaller edition of Master the Basics--doesn&#39;t include the &#34;Test Yourself&#34; and &#34;Diagnostic Analysis&#34; sections of Master the Basics.

In this brilliant assemblage of his writings on music, the first such collection in nearly twenty years, Baraka blends autobiography, history, musical analysis, and political commentary to recall the sounds, people, times, and places he's encountered. As in his earlier classics, <i>Blues People </i>and <i>Black Music, </i>Baraka offers essays on the famous&#x2015;Max Roach, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane&#x2015;and on those whose names are known mainly by jazz aficionados&#x2015;Alan Shorter, Jon Jang, and Malachi Thompson. Baraka's literary style, with its deep roots in poetry, makes palpable his love and respect for his jazz musician friends. His energy and enthusiasm show us again how much Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and the others he lovingly considers mattered. He brings home to us how music itself matters, and how musicians carry and extend that knowledge from generation to generation, providing us, their listeners, with a sense of meaning and belonging.</p><p>"As a commentator on American music, and African American music in particular, Baraka occupies a unique niche. His intelligence, critical sense, passion, strong political stances, involvement with musicians and in the musical world, as well as in his community, give his work a quality unlike any other. As a reviewer and as someone inside the movement, he writes powerfully about music as few others can or do."&#x2015;Steven L. Isoardi, author of <i>Central Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles</i><br><br>"Every jazz musician who has endured beyond changing fashions and warring cultures has had a signature sound. Amiri Baraka&#x2015;from the very beginning of his challenging, fiery presence on the jazz scene&#x2015;has brought probing light, between his off-putting thunderclaps, on what is indeed America's classical music. I sometimes disagree insistently with Amiri, and it's mutual; but when he gets past his parochial pyrotechnics, as in choruses in this book, he brings you into the life force of this music."&#x2015;Nat Hentoff, author of <i>The Jazz Life </i><b>Amiri Baraka </b>(formerly LeRoi Jones) is a writer and critic, the poet laureate of New Jersey, and Professor Emeritus of the State University of New York, Stony Brook.

Have you ever wondered where the difficulties you face are coming from? Joyce Meyer has answers.<br><br>In <i>Your Battles Belong to the Lord</i>, Meyer explains that while some problems may result from a person's choices or circumstances, others are rooted in the spiritual realm. Once you recognize the devil--who is real and active in the world today--as your true enemy and the source of many of your struggles, you can overcome them and live a life of peace, freedom, faith and victory. When facing life's battles, there are certain things you must do for yourself, such as: <ul><li>Diligently studying and applying God's Word</li><li>Trusting Him</li><li>Praying</li><li>Maintaining a positive attitude and thankful heart</li></ul><br>But there are other things only God can do. When you do your part, God does His-and He is always ready and eager to defend you and help you.<br>Each chapter of the book helps you understand how the enemy operates and learn to counter his schemes and strategies so you can live at a new level of strength. Chapter titles include: "Know Your Enemy," "Eliminate Fear," "How the Devil Tries to Deceive People," "Hold Your Peace," "The Power of a Thankful Life," and "Internal Rest."<br><br>In this fresh approach to the subject of spiritual warfare, Meyer focuses not only on the nature and strategies of the enemy, but also on the power and love of God, who always defeats the enemy and leads you to triumph. No matter how difficult your challenges are, if you have God with you, you have all you need to win every battle.</p><p>JOYCE MEYER is one of the world's leading practical Bible teachers.

Moving from the waning Weimar Republic to Auschwitz's fully operating gas chambers, <i>Architects of Annihilation</i> shows how the unthinkable technocratic "solutions" to Germany's wartime problems were not only thought but spelled out and implemented. Documenting the eager participation of some of the country's best and brightest, it rejects interpretations that identify only Nazi leaders as the perpetrators of the Holocaust.</p><br><p> For Hitler's thinkers--career-minded demographers, geographers, economists, civil servants, and academics in the Third Reich's think tanks and bureaucratic offices--Europe was a drawing board on which to work out their grand designs. They were encouraged to rationalize production methods, standardize products, introduce an international division of labor, and modernize and simplify social structures. Ultimately, their work on everything from food shortages to birth control led to the sinister plan to "adjust" the ratio between "productive" or "unproductive" population groups.</p><br><p> The ideas of these ever more radical and ideologically aggressive technocrats culminated in proposals that--using carefully guarded scientific and academic euphemisms--advocated state-directed mass extermination as a necessary and logical component of social modernization. And, not well known outside of Germany, these thinkers proposed not only one "final solution" but serial genocides, planned in detail to be carried out over several decades.</p><br><p> This groundbreaking and controversial account of Hitler's planners received widespread attention when it appeared in Germany. Now a masterful translation makes it available to an English-speaking audience for the first time.</p></p><p><p>"G�tz Aly and Susanne Heim are known in Germany for challenging both establishment historians and the apologists.

Epictetus (AD 50 &#x2013; 135) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses and Enchiridion. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. No writings by Epictetus are truly known. His discourses were transcribed and compiled by his pupil Arrian (author of the Anabasis Alexandri). The main work is The Discourses, four books of which have been preserved (out of the original eight). Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the Enchiridion, or Handbook. In a preface to the Discourses that is addressed to Lucius Gellius, Arrian states that "whatever I heard him say I used to write down, word for word, as best I could, endeavouring to preserve it as a memorial, for my own future use, of his way of thinking and the frankness of his speech." Epictetus maintains that the foundation of all philosophy is self-knowledge, that is, the conviction of our ignorance and gullibility ought to be the first subject of our study. Logic provides valid reasoning and certainty in judgment, but it is subordinate to practical needs. The first and most necessary part of philosophy concerns the application of doctrine, for example, that people should not lie. The second concerns reasons, e.g. why people should not lie. While the third, lastly, examines and establishes the reasons. This is the logical part, which finds reasons, shows what is a reason, and that a given reason is a correct one. This last part is necessary, but only on account of the second, which again is rendered necessary by the first.</p><p></p><h2>The Animals in My Life: Stories of a Country Vet</h2><p>The veterinarian shares anecdotes about the animals he has encountered, including a puppy with a handicap, an attacking goose, and Hollywood&#39;s horses</p><p></p><h2>Chasing Time: Vintage Wristwatches for the Discerning Collector</h2><p>The early 2000s were an important period, spanning a time when mechanical watches had quite rightly retaken their place in the world market. We all may have a digital device in our pocket that is more accurate than a mechanical watch, but a timepiece has soul, personality, and history. The collection in this book is a step into the world of vintage watch collecting, with a range of photographs, intricate research, and accessible reference material that will intrigue both the casual and avid enthusiast. The collection showcases some of the most interesting, luxurious, and functional 20th-century (1930&#x2013;1980) mechanical timepieces ever to be produced, including Heuer's Autavia, Rolex's Submariner, Gallet's MultiChron, Zenith's De Luca, and the Universal Space Compax.</p><p>Alistair Thomas Gibbons grew up in Liverpool, England, and trained as a &#34;Special Effects Editor&#34; in London and worked in Hong Kong and Germany during the 1990s.

So begins this profoundly moving and disturbing tragedy that, perhaps more than any other work in literature, challenges the notion of a coherent and just universe. The king and others pay dearly for their shortcomings&#x2013;as madness, murder, and the anguish of insight and forgiveness that arrive too late combine to make this an all-embracing tragedy of evil and suffering.<br><br>Each Edition Includes:<br>� Comprehensive explanatory notes <br>� Vivid introductions and the most up-to-date scholarship <br>� Clear, modernized spelling and punctuation, enabling contemporary readers to understand the Elizabethan English<br>� Completely updated, detailed bibliographies and performance histories <br>� An interpretive essay on film adaptations of the play, along with an extensive filmography<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

His father was a dairy farmer and lay preacher in the Presbyterian church, his mother an English teacher in the local schools. At age 12 he accidentally killed his brother Gilbert by running him over with a heavy farm machine (this tragedy surfaced many years later in the short story "Redemption"). He went on to become one of the most provocative and successful American novelists of his generation, garnering critical praise and a popular following for his fiction. Raymond Carver was one of his many successful students. The author of many novels, plays, and transliterations of medieval texts, Gardner also composed operas and librettos, as well as being a painter, he played the French horn. He died in a motorcycle accident in Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Anne Truitt in Japan</h2><p>This catalogue focuses on the formative drawings that Anne Truitt (1921&#x2013;2004) made while living in Tokyo from 1964 to 1967&#x2015;a pivotal moment for her, both artistically and intellectually. Though she later destroyed the sculptures she produced there (all in aluminum, a material she ultimately found unsuited to her intentions), this process of discovery was essential to the clarification of her sculptural vision. The innovations she developed in Japan, many in the form of drawings, would profoundly inform her lifelong practice. This book presents the full range of these works on paper, from hard-edge polygons to veil-like fields of color. An illustrated chronology provides a detailed account of her experiences in Japan and its impact on her subsequent work. Also reproduced for the first time are photographs of the 23 sculptures she made in Japan, all since lost or destroyed.</p><p></p><h2>Eccentrics: A Study of Sanity and Strangeness</h2><p>From 1859 to 1880, Joshua Abraham Norton thought he was Emperor of the United States. Ann Atkin keeps 7,500 garden gnomes in her backyard. Brooklyn artist Peter McGough dresses and acts as if it were 1895. These are just a few of the eccentrics discussed by Dr. Weeks, the world&#39;s foremost expert on the subject.</p><p>This book summarizes findings from the first systematic study of "eccentrics": highly talented and unusual people who are somewhere between "normal" and "nuts". This is a domain occupied by genuine geniuses and charming crackpots whose common feature is that they refuse to hold commonly held beliefs or refuse to act in accordance with the norms of society. Although the book would have been a more compelling read if it treated each individual in more depth, and its conclusions more convincing if there were more tables of data, it is nonetheless a delightful book that will give you either more respect for the eccentric (if you believe that you are "normal") or greater confidence in yourself (if you suspect--or know--that <i>you</i> are eccentric).

Dusty, broken, and all but forgotten, it caught Drew Harvell&#x2019;s eye. Fashioned in intricate detail by the father-son glassmaking team of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, the octopus belonged to a menagerie of unusual marine creatures that had been packed away for decades in a storage unit. More than 150 years earlier, the Blaschkas had been captivated by marine invertebrates and spun their likenesses into glass, documenting the life of oceans untouched by climate change and human impacts. Inspired by the Blaschkas&#x2019; uncanny replicas, Harvell set out in search of their living counterparts. In <i>A Sea of Glass</i>, she recounts this journey of a lifetime, taking readers along as she dives beneath the ocean's surface to a rarely seen world, revealing the surprising and unusual biology of some of the most ancient animals on the tree of life. On the way, we glimpse a century of change in our ocean ecosystems and learn which of the living matches for the Blaschkas&#x2019; creations are, indeed, as fragile as glass.<br><br> Drew Harvell and the Blaschka menagerie are the subjects of the documentary <i>Fragile Legacy</i>, which won the Best Short Film award at the 2015 Blue Ocean Film Festival &amp; Conservation Summit.

Army leaders must be able to act decisively and effectively in challenging situations. But the Army, despite its organizational structure, does not train leaders in a hierarchical manner. Dispersed leadership is the key to the success of the Army leadership model. <p>Now, for the first time, you can have access to the Army's successful leadership philosophy and the principles that are outlined in <i>Be Know Do</i> the official Army Leadership Manual. <i>Be Know Do</i> makes this critical information available to civilian leaders in all sectors--business, government, and nonprofit--and gives them the guidelines they need to create an organization where leadership thrives.</p></p><p><b>Praise for <i>Be * Know * Do</i></b> <p>"The Army does two things each and every day: it trains its soldiers, and it grows them into leaders.

Yet such theories, addressing the world and its problems, must respond to the real and changing dilemmas of the day. A brilliant work of practical philosophy, <i>Frontiers of Justice</i> is dedicated to this proposition. Taking up three urgent problems of social justice neglected by current theories and thus harder to tackle in practical terms and everyday life, Martha Nussbaum seeks a theory of social justice that can guide us to a richer, more responsive approach to social cooperation. </p><p> The idea of the social contract--especially as developed in the work of John Rawls--is one of the most powerful approaches to social justice in the Western tradition. But as Nussbaum demonstrates, even Rawls's theory, suggesting a contract for mutual advantage among approximate equals, cannot address questions of social justice posed by unequal parties. How, for instance, can we extend the equal rights of citizenship--education, health care, political rights and liberties--to those with physical and mental disabilities? How can we extend justice and dignified life conditions to all citizens of the world? And how, finally, can we bring our treatment of nonhuman animals into our notions of social justice? Exploring the limitations of the social contract in these three areas, Nussbaum devises an alternative theory based on the idea of "capabilities." She helps us to think more clearly about the purposes of political cooperation and the nature of political principles--and to look to a future of greater justice for all. </p></p><p><b>Martha C.

Written with students and practitioners in mind, it challenges past research that has traditionally argued bicultural parents are incompetent, apathetic, and do not value education, hence the cause of their children&#x2019;s academic underachievement. This book sheds new light on why bicultural parents often mistrust the school system and uncovers the contradictions inherent in the relationship between them and school personnel.</p><p>?<i>The Power of Parents</i> is a superb contribution to the growing study of bicultural (for example, Latino) parental involvement in the public school system. In an engaging and intellectually stimulating manner, Edward M. Olivos masterfully crafts a case that authentic dialogue between bicultural parents and schools will not occur without tension or conflict. Drawing from models of structural inequality in society and anti-deficit thinking, and the actual voices of disenfranchised Latino parents, Dr. Olivos provides the field with a probing and intellectually useful theoretical framework that seeks possible pathways for emancipatory and democratic experiences for bicultural parent involvement. I highly recommend this outstanding book, particularly for use in teacher education programs.? <i>Richard R.

For more than twenty years, when engaged couples have come to me for premarital counsel---either in my capacity as a physician or as a pastor---I have asked them to sit back to back so they can&#39;t see each other&#39;s response and then have asked them to raise the number of fingers for the number of children they hope to have. Rarely have both the man and woman given the same answer. This exercise helps many couples realize that in their plans for marriage, an important consideration has been left out. &#39;How many?&#39; and &#39;When?&#39; can be complex questions. * An engaged woman attending a Christian college overhears one of her professors explaining why he has six children: &#39;We don&#39;t use contraception---that would mean a lack of faith. We prefer to trust God.&#39; She wonders how she and her fiance will balance &#39;stepping out in faith&#39; with weighing the pros and cons and making wise decisions. * A wife has been using the pill, but she and her husband recently heard that the pill causes abortion by killing the early embryo. Now they have second thoughts and are trying to figure out what method of contraception, if any, is best for them. * Feeling her biological clock ticking, a wife is eager to stop using contraception. Her husband, concerned to first establish financial security, wants to wait. Their endless discussions about when to stop using contraception are getting them nowhere. * Acouple with five children have always thought it was wrong to use contraception but have now been told that the wife&#39;s health would be endangered if she were to have another child. They have no idea where to begin in considering the options. * An engaged couple plans to use contraception after they marry, but they have no idea what options are available and which ones fit within their pro-life beliefs. Each of the individuals in these situations has desired to honor God with his or her choices, so they have turned to Scripture for guidance. There they&#39;ve found much written about living sexually pure lives but nothing directly about contraception---the deliberate prevention of pregnancy. Some people assume that the Bible is silent about contraception because it did not exist in Bible times. Yet some methods, such as withdrawal, have been around for thousands of years, as we will discuss. This raises even more questions. Is the Bible silent on the subject because it is a relatively unimportant issue? Or were certain practices assumed? In exploring such questions, we will draw on our theological training and our discussions with hundreds of couples. In addition, my many years of medical practice as an obstetrician and gynecologist, my experience in pastoral ministry, and my years of teaching at the seminary level provide case studies and quotes that come from real-life encounters. LET&#39;S TALK ABOUT IT 1. How many children do you want? How many children does your spouse want? 2. Is there a difference between the two numbers? 3. Did you know this before you married? 4. Have either of your changed your minds about this since you married? PART 1: MYTHS AND 22 FACTS 5. Have you come to a consensus about family building? If not, what needs to happen for you to find a place of oneness? 6. In general, how do you as a couple handle conflict resolution? Would you say you &#39;find one another&#39;s heart&#39;? Does one of you tend to give in while the other gets his or her way? Do you both seek unity and godliness through love? If not, what steps need to be taken to move in that direction?</p><h2>The One Year Chronological Bible Expressions NLT, Deluxe (Hardcover, Blue)</h2><p>The #1-selling daily reading Bible is more personal than ever with space to read, write, and create!

Now, in an exciting, fast-paced historical narrative ranging across two centuries, Mark Ronan takes us on an exhilarating tour of this final mathematical quest. <br> Ronan describes how the quest to understand symmetry really began with the tragic young genius Evariste Galois, who died at the age of 20 in a duel. Galois, who spent the night before he died frantically scribbling his unpublished discoveries, used symmetry to understand algebraic equations, and he discovered that there were building blocks or "atoms of symmetry." Most of these building blocks fit into a table, rather like the periodic table of elements, but mathematicians have found 26 exceptions. The biggest of these was dubbed "the Monster"--a giant snowflake in 196,884 dimensions. Ronan, who personally knows the individuals now working on this problem, reveals how the Monster was only dimly seen at first. As more and more mathematicians became involved, the Monster became clearer, and it was found to be not monstrous but a beautiful form that pointed out deep connections between symmetry, string theory, and the very fabric and form of the universe. <br> This story of discovery involves extraordinary characters, and Mark Ronan brings these people to life, vividly recreating the growing excitement of what became the biggest joint project ever in the field of mathematics.

The direct cause of the accident was cited as the depositing of a uranyl nitrate solution--containing about 16.6 kg of uranium, which exceeded the critical mass--into a precipitation tank. Three workers were exposed to extreme doses of radiation. <br><br>Hiroshi Ouchi, one of these workers, was transferred to the University of Tokyo Hospital Emergency Room, three days after the accident. Dr. Maekawa and his staff initially thought that Ouchi looked relatively well for a person exposed to such radiation levels. He could talk, and only his right hand was a little swollen with redness. However, his condition gradually weakened as the radioactivity broke down the chromosomes in his cells. <br><br>The doctors were at a loss as to what to do. There were very few precedents and proven medical treatments for the victims of radiation poisoning. Less than 20 nuclear accidents had occurred in the world to that point, and most of those happened 30 years ago. This book documents the following 83 days of treatment until his passing, with detailed descriptions and explanations of the radiation poisoning.</p><p>NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai) or Japan Broadcasting Corporation is Japan&#39;s public broadcaster.

The documentary won the Gold Nymph Award--the highest award possible--at the 42nd Monte Carlo Television Festival in 2002.&#x201c;Stylistically resembling a fictional narrative, this grim chronicle of Ouchi&#x2019;s deterioration demonstrates the humanity and pyschology of the medical profession in extreme situations. In that sense, it&#x1fbf;s an interesting companion to [Osamu Tezuka&#x2019;s] Black Jack manga.

Mark Graham gracefully renders these simple pleasures with impressionistic landscapes that show a family's camping adventure in the wilderness&#x2014;a special time of togetherness, joy, and wonder. With its spare text and breathtaking art, here is a perfect gift that will speak to readers of all ages and diverse religious backgrounds.</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), the essayist and poet, is widely considered one of the most important thinkers of nineteenth-century America.Ages 3-8. Emerson's passionate regard for nature and his advocacy of environmentalism are his legacy to us and one that young readers will experience in this beautiful book based on his classic poem. Emerson's philosophy is expressed in his thankfulness to the Father for the flowers, the tender grass, the bird songs, the streams and sky, the breezes, and the blooming trees. Graham's lovely impressionistic oil paintings are a resonant accompaniment to the words. They sing with brilliant cool shades of blue and green, bright flashes of yellow, hot red, or orange. The deeply spiritual aspects of the poem are made accessible with scenes of a family hiking together, discovering mountain vistas, and apple trees in bloom. A brother and sister leap and run, watch an owl in flight, and roast marshmallows--sweet images set against the quiet five-syllable refrain, "Father, we thank you."

Usually for doing little more than standing there.<br><br> Juliette, a woman he met during that time, has been stopped by police well over one hundred times, arrested upward of sixty times, and has given up more than a year of her life serving week-long jail sentences. Her most common crime? Simply sitting on the sidewalk&#x2014;an arrestable offense in LA.<br><br> Why? What purpose did those arrests serve, for society or for Juliette? How did we reach a point where we&#x2019;ve cut support for our poorest citizens, yet are spending ever more on policing and prisons? That&#x2019;s the complicated, maddening story that Stuart tells in <i>Down, Out and Under Arrest</i>, a close-up look at the hows and whys of policing poverty in the contemporary United States. What emerges from Stuart&#x2019;s years of fieldwork&#x2014;not only with Skid Row residents, but with the police charged with managing them&#x2014;is a tragedy built on mistakes and misplaced priorities more than on heroes and villains. He reveals a situation where a lot of people on both sides of this issue are genuinely trying to do the right thing, yet often come up short. Sometimes, in ways that do serious harm.<br><br> At a time when distrust between police and the residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods has never been higher, Stuart&#x2019;s book helps us see where we&#x2019;ve gone wrong, and what steps we could take to begin to change the lives of our poorest citizens&#x2014;and ultimately our society itself&#x2014;for the better.</p><p><b>Forrest Stuart</b> is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago.<br><p>&#x201c;An intimate, multifaceted portrait of the police, residents and activists in their own voices. <i>Down, Out, and Under Arrest</i> adds new insights and much-needed complexity to the current debates on policing in the poorest urban areas of the U.S. It is a vivid and insightful five-year study of Los Angeles&#x2019;s Skid Row that contradicts much of the conventional wisdom about policing and the urban poor.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For Stuart, therapeutic policing legitimates punitive treatment of the worst-off without making them or anyone else better off. Or rather, turning the police into social workers&#x2014;and they make &#x2018;abysmal social workers,&#x2019; we are told&#x2014;benefits not the street dwellers but the developers who can now make a profit in the domesticated neighborhood. <i>Down, Out, and Under Arrest</i> is thus a well-supported critique of therapeutic policing and, by extension, of similar paternalistic efforts to help the poor by hassling them into good behavior. . . . Fascinating.&#x201d; (<i>LA Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this fine study, Stuart has put some disturbing flesh on the bones of neoliberalism. His vivid description of the complex worlds of skid row and the widening of coercive social control under the guise of reintegration may remind readers of critiques of social work written in the 1960s and 1970s. This new pathway of disciplinary enterprise, however, is backed up by guns, handcuffs and the threat of incarceration.&#x201d; (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An important and disturbing book. . . . Stuart portrays interesting, thoughtful people located in a tenuous yet all-embracing life world.

This is urban ethnography at its best.&#x201d; (<i>Mitchell Duneier, author of Ghetto: The Invention of a Place, the History of an Idea</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Down, Out, and Under Arrest</i> is a trenchant ethnographic account of how big city police harass and &#x2018;manage&#x2019; some of the most desperate people of the urban environment, but equally important, how these impoverished denizens&#x2014;including residents of SRO hotels, skid row, and homeless settlements&#x2014;wisely manage the police in their everyday lives, powerfully revealing the enormous human toll of the &#x2018;neoliberal state.&#x2019; This is a timely work of importance that deserves to be read by a wide audience.&#x201d; (<i>Elijah Anderson, author of Code of the Street and The Cosmopolitan Canopy</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Stuart&#x2019;s Down, <i>Out, and Under Arrest</i> describes a segment of reality that is virtually unknown to Americans&#x2014;how policing is reshaping the experiences of extreme urban poverty. The challenges of everyday life in Skid Row are revealed in sharp relief in his compelling narrative. Indeed, Stuart&#x2019;s insightful account, based on years of field research, is replete with original findings. This well written book is a must-read not only for students and scholars of urban poverty, but for the general public as well.&#x201d; (<i>William Julius Wilson, author of The Truly Disadvantaged</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Stuart straddles the gap between academic rigor and reader engagement with this impressive urban ethnography. He not only tells the everyday story of the urban poor of LA&#x2019;s Skid Row, he also tells the ideological story of the men and women who police them. This important book represents a detailed and nuanced account of urban policing in a cultural and political environment where the debate has mostly become stagnant and binary.&nbsp;The author maintains an impressively balanced and objective approach throughout the narrative.&nbsp;In addition to fascinating insights into life on Skid Row, Stuart provides an engaging example of ethnographic research, including an approachable methodological appendix.&nbsp;An excellent addition to library collections on social problems, policing, or research methods. Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is both a searing indictment of the Los Angeles Safer Cities Initiative and an increased understanding of how collectives can work to resist misguided civic policies.&#x201d; (<i>Criminal Law and Criminal Justice Books</i>)<br><br>"In this exemplary ethnography of a Los Angeles neighborhood, we see the effects of community and institutional framing on the policing of poverty, on social service delivery, and on everyday resistance. . . .&nbsp;Stuart&#x2019;s book is vital in analyzing the far-reaching effects of neighborhood framing and the policing of poverty. <i>Down, Out, and Under Arrest </i>should be read widely, but especially by those interested in urban neighborhoods, policing, non-profits, poverty, culture, and social movements."

Now Diana Donald presents the first major study of these caricatures, which challenges many assumptions about them. She shows that they were a widely disseminated form of political expression and propaganda as subtle and eloquent as the written word.<br><br>Donald analyzes the meanings of the prints, applying current perspectives on the eighteenth century about the changing roles of women and constructions of gender, the alleged rise of a consumer society, the growth of political awareness outside aristocratic circles, and the problems of defining "class" values in the later Georgian era. She discusses, for example, the social position of the Georgian satirist within the hierarchy of high and low art production; the relation between the shifting styles of political prints and the antagonisms of different political cultures; caricatures of fashion as expressions of ambivalent attitudes to luxury and "high society"; treatment of the crowd in the prints and the light this sheds on the myth of the freeborn Englishman; and what caricatures reveal about British reactions to the French Revolution in the 1790s. Donald concludes by describing the demise of the Georgian satirical print in the early nineteenth century, which she attributes in part to the new and urgent political purposes of radicals in the post-Napoleonic era. Illustrated with works by Gillray, Rowlandson, and other artists, many of which have never been published before, the book will be an enlightening and enjoyable reference for scholars and the general reader.</p><p>William Pitt commissioned them. Alexander Pope collected them. The Prince of Wales bribed their makers to stop them from being produced. Not even the most respected and sharp-penned political cartoonist of our time wields the influences, or, it could be argued, possesses the artistic skills of the satirical engravers of England in the 18th century who elevated caricature to the level of high art. Diana Donald, a professor of art history at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, illuminates the art and meaning of more than 200 etchings by the top practitioners of the day (Rowlandson, Gillray, the Cruikshank brothers) as well as less-skilled amateurs and professionals who were popular once but are now mostly forgotten.<b>Diana Donald</b> is professor of art history and head of the department of history of art and design at the Manchester Metropolitan University.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Certified Quality Improvement Associate Handbook, Third Edition</h2><p>ASQs Certified Quality Improvement Associate (CQIA) certification is designed to introduce the basics of quality to organizations and individuals not currently working within the field of quality.

In <i>China&#x2019;s Superbank</i>, Bloomberg authors Michael Forsythe and Henry Sanderson outline how the bank is at the center of China's domestic economic growth and how it is helping to expand China's influence in strategically important overseas markets.</p> <p>100 percent owned by the Chinese government, the CDB holds the key to understanding the inner workings of China's state-led economic development model, and its most glaring flaws. The bank is at the center of the country's efforts to build a world-class network of highways, railroads, and power grids, pioneering a lending scheme to local governments that threatens to spawn trillions of yuan in bad loans. It is doling out credit lines by the billions to Chinese solar and wind power makers, threatening to bury global competitors with a flood of cheap products. Another $45 billion in credit has been given to the country's two biggest telecom equipment makers who are using the money to win contracts around the globe, helping fulfill the goal of China's leaders for its leading companies to "go global."</p> <p>Bringing the story of China Development Bank to life by crisscrossing China to investigate the quality of its loans, <i>China&#x2019;s Superbank</i> travels the globe, from Africa, where its China-Africa fund is displacing Western lenders in a battle for influence, to the oil fields of Venezuela.</p> <ul> <li>Offers a fascinating insight into the China Development Bank (CDB), the driver of China's rapid economic development</li> <li>Travels the globe to show how the CDB is helping Chinese businesses "go global"</li> <li>Written by two respected reporters at Bloomberg News</li> </ul> <p>As China's influence continues to grow around the world, many people are asking how far it will extend. <i>China&#x2019;s Superbank</i> addresses these vital questions, looking at the institution at the heart of this growth.</p></p><p><p>China's rise as a global economic superpower, the success of its top companies, and its continuing domestic boom is intricately tied to China Development Bank (CDB). This less-than-transparent institution, which is wholly owned by the Chinese government, has become <i>the</i> financial enabler of this nation's growth and is arguably the most powerful bank in the world.</p> <p>While development banks have long existed to finance political projects, infrastructure, and other initiatives, nothing comes close to CDB in scope.</p> <p>In <i>China's Superbank,</i> authors Henry Sanderson and Michael Forsythe&#x2014;both Bloomberg journalists working in Beijing&#x2014;combine on-the-scene reporting and interviews from across the world with numbers crunched from Chinese bond prospectuses to put CDB in perspective, and help you understand the economic phenomenon that is China.</p> <p>Along the way, you'll not only become familiar with the growing accomplishments and influence of CDB, but you'll also gain valuable insights into the darker side of this political-financial institution&#x2014;one that has never had to answer to anyone apart from its state shareholders. You'll also discover how China's seemingly unstoppable banking system could potentially be saddled with bad debt from trillions of yuan invested in projects with questionable economic value both at home and abroad.</p> <p>Throughout the book, the authors:</p> <ul> <li>Explore CDB's hallmark innovation&#x2014;the system of local government finance&#x2014;which has transformed China's landscape in just over a decade by pumping trillions of yuan into various domestic projects</li> <li>Profile Chen Yuan, the Chairman of CDB since 1998, and discuss how he's been instrumental in reasserting the Communist Party in China's economy, while managing to preserve enough independence from the government to make decent investment decisions and function as a commercially driven institution</li> <li>Analyze CDB's China-Africa Development Fund&#x2014;China's largest private equity fund investing in Africa&#x2014;and its attempts to stimulate manufacturing in Ethiopia, and CDB's lending to Ghana</li> <li>Address CDB's work to secure a steady flow of oil and gas to China through loans-for-energy deals around the world, particularly to Venezuela</li> <li>Examine CDB's lines of credit that have helped new Chinese firms in telecom and alternative energy win significant global projects, as well as how the bank is developing a new form of private equity financing through CDB Capital.</li> </ul> <p>As China's influence continues to grow around the world, many people are asking how far it will extend. <i>China's Superbank</i> addresses this vital question, looking at the institution at the heart of its growth.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>China's Superbank</i></b></p> <p>"The phenomenal economic rise of China and its growing global role have been driven by a unique mix of political and economic actors. China Development Bank has been at the center of much of this growth especially as the principal banker in China's overseas commodity investments. Henry and Michael's timely book, <i>China's Superbank</i>, details for the first time the role that CDB has played under the focused leadership of its Chairman Chen Yuan.

These tiny, ghostly particles are formed by the billions in stars and pass through us constantly, unseen, at almost the speed of light. Yet half a century after their discovery, we still know less about them than all the other varieties of matter that have ever been seen.<br> In this engaging, concise volume, renowned scientist and popular writer Frank Close gives a vivid account of the discovery of neutrinos and our growing understanding of their significance, also touching on some speculative ideas concerning the possible uses of neutrinos and their role in the early universe. Close begins with the early history of the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and Marie and Pierre Curie, the early model of the atom by Ernest Rutherford, and problems with these early atomic models, and Wolfgang Pauli's solution to that problem by inventing the concept of neutrino (named by Enrico Fermi, "neutrino" being Italian for "little neutron"). The book describes how the confirmation of Pauli's theory didn't occur until 1956, when Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines detected neutrinos, and reveals that the first "natural" neutrinos were finally detected by Reines in 1965 (before that, they had only been detected in reactors or accelerators). Close takes us to research experiments miles underground that are able to track neutrinos' fleeting impact as they pass through vast pools of cadmium chloride and he explains why they are becoming of such interest to cosmologists--if we can track where a neutrino originated we will be looking into the far distant reaches of the universe. <br> In telling the story of the neutrino, Close offers a fascinating portrait of a strand of modern physics that sheds light on everything from the workings of the atom and the power of the sun.</p><p><br><strong>Frank Close</strong>, OBE, is Professor of Physics at Oxford University and a Fellow of Exeter College. He was formerly vice president of the British Association for Advancement of Science, Head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and Head of Communications and Public Education at CERN. He is the author of several books, including <em>The Void</em> (OUP, 2007) and the best-selling <em>Lucifer's Legacy</em> (OUP, 2000). He was the winner of the Kelvin Medal of the Institute of Physics for his "outstanding contributions to the public understanding of physics."<br>*Starred Review* Confronting his colleagues&#x2019; failure to explain beta radiation, the revolutionary physicist Wolfang Pauli advanced a &#x201c;remedy that could seem incredible.&#x201d; Still, he justified himself in risking implausibility: &#x201c;Only the one who dares can win.&#x201d; In this engaging account of epoch-making science, Close chronicles the astonishing consequences of Pauli&#x2019;s intellectual daring. Readers see how the pioneering analyses of Ernest Rutherford first exposed the impossibility of explaining beta radiation within standard scientific formulas and how Pauli resolved the anomaly by hypothesizing a mysterious subatomic particle, dubbed the &#x201c;neutrino&#x201d; by an intrigued Enrico Fermi. But Pauli&#x2019;s brainchild left theorists skeptical and empiricists frustrated, as they repeatedly failed in their attempts to observe the particle. Refreshingly lucid writing gives general readers access to the exciting events that finally established the reality of the neutrino while opening stunning new perspectives on the origins of the cosmos. This access not only clarifies the complex science of bosons and muons but also illuminates the cross-grained humanity of Bruno Pontecorvo, the forgotten genius whose uncanny predictions about multiflavored neutrinos have, one by one, found verification, and Ray Davis, the stubbornly determined investigator of neutrinos born of solar fusion. A striking reminder that brilliant minds can penetrate the narrowest of narrow places. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>Feedback Control Systems</h2><p><p> <i>Feedback Control Systems, 5/e </i></p><p><i>This text offers a thorough analysis of the principles of classical and modern feedback control.

Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Scene Painting Projects for Theatre</h2><p>The art, practice, and technique of scene painting is an essential part of theatre design.

This definitive manual systematically explains its approach to meditation, complete with definitions, pointing-out instructions, and advice for the many pitfalls and errors that beset practitioners.

Author Jane Hamilton leads us through the arid life of Ruth Grey, who extracts what small pleasures and graces she can from a tiny Illinois town and the broken people who inhabit it. Ruth's prime tormentor is her mother May, whose husband died in World War II and took her future with him. More poor familial luck has given Ruth a brother who is a math prodigy; Matt sucks up any stray attention like a black hole. Ruth is left to survive on her own resources, which are meager. She struggles along, subsisting on crumbs of affection meted out by her Aunt Sid and, later, her screwed-up husband Ruby. Hamilton has perfect pitch. So perfect that you wince with pain for confused but fundamentally good Ruth as she walks a dead-end path.

An estimated 400 Jews lost their lives in the anti-Semitic pogrom and more than 30,000 were imprisoned or sent to concentration camps, where many were brutally mistreated. Thousands more fled their homelands in Germany and Austria, shocked by what they had seen, heard and experienced. What they took with them was not only the pain of saying farewell but also the memory of terrible scenes: attacks by mobs of drunken Nazis, public humiliations, burning synagogues, inhuman conditions in overcrowded prison cells and concentration camp barracks. The reactions of neighbours and passersby to these barbarities ranged from sympathy and aid to scorn, mockery, and abuse. <p>In 1939 the Harvard sociologist Edward Hartshorne gathered eyewitness accounts of the Kristallnacht from hundreds of Jews who had fled, but Hartshorne joined the Secret Service shortly afterwards and the accounts he gathered were forgotten - until now. These eyewitness testimonies - published here for the first time, with a foreword by Saul Friedl�nder, the Pulitzer Prize historian and Holocaust survivor - paint a harrowing picture of everyday violence in one of Europe's darkest moments.</p> <p>This unique and disturbing document will be of great interest to anyone interested in modern history, Nazi Germany and the historical experience of the Jews.</p></p><p><p>Uta Gerhardt is a German sociologist and professor emeritus at the University of Heidelberg.

In reality, these events were but the faintest of preludes to what was about to happen to the Jews in Germany and in occupied Europe. Nonetheless, these reports carry a poignancy of their own that overwhelmingly evokes the suffocating and terror filled atmosphere of Jewish everyday existence in the Reich during those November days and the immediate pre-war months."<br> <b>Saul Friedlander, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of <i>The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945<br> <br> </i></b>"What sets this anthology, edited by German sociologist Uta Gerhardt and literary agent Thomas Karlauf, apart from other firsthand accounts is the immediacy of the testimonies.

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<br><br>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

He also introduced us to "an unerringly lucid writer who knows how to translate architectural ideas into layman's terms" (<b>The Dallas Morning News</b>). Rybczynski's vast knowledge, his sense of wonder, and his elegantly uncluttered prose shine on every page of his latest meditation on the art of building. <p><b>Looking Around</b> is about architecture as an art of compromise<b>&#x2014;</b>between beauty and function, aspiration and engineering, builders and clients. It is the story of the Seagram Building in New York and the Wexner Center for the Visual Arts in Columbus, Ohio<b>&#x2014;</b>a museum that opened without a single painting on view, so that critics could better appreciate its design. But what of the visitors who want a building that displays art well? What of those who work in the building? <b>Looking Around</b> explores the notion of the architect as superstar and assesses giants from Palladio to Michael Graves, styles from classicism to high tech. It demonstrates how architecture actually works<b>&#x2014;</b>or doesn't<b>&#x2014;</b>in corporate headquarters, airports, private homes, and the special buildings designed to represent our civilization. </p><p>For all its erudition, <b>Looking Around</b> is also bracingly straightforward. Rybczynski looks closely and critically at structures that may once have dazzled us with their ostentation and expense, and sees them as triumphs or failures<b>&#x2014;</b>of aesthetic ideals and of lasting function. This is a fascinating and illuminating book about an art form integral to our lives.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Witold Rybczynski</b> of Polish parentage, was born in Edinburgh in 1943, raised in Surrey, and attended Jesuit schools in England and Canada. He received Bachelor of Architecture (1960) and Master of Architecture (1972) degrees from McGill University in Montreal. He is the author of more than fifty articles and papers on the subject of housing, architecture, and technology, including the books <b>Taming the Tiger</b>, <b>Paper Heroes</b>, <b>The Most Beautiful House in the World</b>, <b>Waiting for the Weekend</b>, and <b>Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture</b> (all available in Penguin), and most recently, <b>City Life</b>. He lives with his wife, Shirley Hallam, in Philadelphia and is the Martin and Margy Myerson Professor of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania.Rybczynski is an architectural critic whose interests and resulting essays roam far from the specific building(s) he is enjoying. These critiques employ a gentle, even relaxed prose that allows readers to share Rybczynski's aesthetic connections and his expansions on the role of building styles in our constructed world. The book contains 35 brief pieces divided into three sections: "Homes and Houses," "Special Places," and "The Art of Building." Rybczynski takes us from the demise of the parlour (is the living room next?), to the Nixon Library, to the future of Chicago architecture. By wandering confidently through a broad anthropological as well as architectural landscape, the author is able to unite a wide range of design details into insightful analysis. This work is recommended for both academic and public libraries.<br><i>- David Bryant, Belleville P.L., N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>If: A Father&#39;s Advice to His Son</h2><p><b> What makes a boy into a man? </b> <br> <br> <b>Courage.</b><br> <b>Confidence.<br> Patience.<br> Integrity...</b> <br> <br> For more than one hundred years, this classic poems has inspired readers to reach for the best in themselves. <br> <br> In pictures and words, here's what every boy needs to know most.</p><p><b>Charles R.

A lovely shot of a boy heading a soccer ball accompanies the opening couplet: "If you can keep your head/when all about you/are losing theirs/and blaming it on you...." The mood and actions in most of the illustrations clearly invoke the verse, although two are murky and enigmatic. Shadows and dispersed light are used artfully and, interestingly, all of the people have their backs to the camera or appear in profile; their anonymity confirms the sense of universality found in the poem. The attractive presentation includes an eye-catching cover, a blend of font sizes in alternating black or white print, and a judicious use of white space that gives the eye some rest between the many action-filled images. In a thoughtful afterword, Smith explains why he chose to interpret this particular poem. Teachers and parents will enjoy sharing this book with kids; it is a good vehicle to promote discussion.&#x2014;<i>Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The authors explore the background and context for all major developments during the era, as well as capsule biographies and character analyses of key figures. Tracing the Cold War from its roots in East&#x2013;West tensions before and during World War II through its origins in the immediate postwar era, the book concludes with the Cold War&#x2019;s legacy, which continues today.

Patton. In 1999, after fifty-five years in the vault of the Huntington Library in southern California, the Nuremberg Laws resurfaced and were put on public display for the first time at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. In this far-ranging, interdisciplinary study that is part historical analysis, part cultural critique, part detective story, and part memoir, Tony Platt explores a range of interrelated issues: war-time looting, remembrance of the holocaust, German and American eugenics, and the public responsibilities of museums and cultural centers. This book is based on original research by the author and co-researcher, historian Cecilia O&#39;Leary, in government, military, and library archives; interviews and oral histories; and participant observation. It is both a detailed, scholarly analysis and a record of the author&#39;s activist efforts to correct the historical record.</p><p>Anthony M.

However, the majority of mistakes are caused by the misuse of paint rather than artistic inability.<br><br>Understanding the medium and how to use it will turn failure into success, and discovering the truth about how to use watercolors is exciting, liberating and enormously rewarding.<br><br>The Watercolour Enigma is based on a practical course by artist Stephen Coates, and is designed to take the student through a process of learning rarely seen in other practical art books. By examining the basic science of watercolour - the properties of water and color pigment, and through a series of practical, straightforward, step-by-step painting exercises, budding painters will leave Stephen's book not only with a mine of watercolor knowledge, but also will step away with a selection of stunning paintings they will be proud to have painted.<br><br>Fulfil your dream and learn to paint like a true, watercolour expert.</p><p>Stephen Coates was born in Sheffield in 1960. Son of a draughtsman, he was introduced to drawing at a very young age. He excelled in art at school but chose a career in retail, working first in the music industry for 16 years followed by another 16 years running his own catering business.<br><br>Largely self-taught, Stephen specialised in watercolours and over a period of twenty years, developed his own style and unique brand of teaching in his spare time. In 2011, he traded his sandwich business for a career in art and teaching. He became a full-time professional freelance artist and set up his own studio in Sheffield with a purpose-designed teaching facility. He runs courses, workshops and hosts his own amateur art groups. He also demonstrates his skills and shares his expertise at art society meetings all over England.<br><br>Stephen's successful teaching business inspired him to write and compile a watercolour teaching manual. He wanted to bring the excitement of his live teaching into the pages of a book so that students could truly experience the learning process in the comfort of their own homes.<br><br>Stephen exhibits at a variety of art shows and loves to share his experiences with people.The science of watercolour is intriguing but, if the very idea makes your eyes glaze over, prepare to be intrigued. This bills itself as &#34;a complete course revealing the secrets and science of watercolour&#34; and, it oozes practicality on every page. Stephen quite rightly understands that a watercolourist&#39;s only interest in the physical properties of their medium relates to what it can do for them and how they can exploit and control its behaviour. To this end, he explains the properties of water, how and why washes blend and the ways in which different pigments mix. The whole process is constructed as a series of exercises and demonstrations that show you what&#39;s happening rather than simply telling you, although there are also panels that explain the technicalities in simple terms. If you want to get the most out of your medium, this is a fascinating and absorbing look under the hood. * Artbookreview.net *</p><h2>Solutions to Social Problems from the Bottom Up: Successful Social Movements</h2><p><p>This brief reader examines a number of organized movements that have successfully brought about reform and change "from the bottom up."</p></p><p><p> <b>Solutions to Social Problems from the Bottom Up: Successful Social Movements</b> </p> <p> <b>D.

It was Lipchitz who embraced the movement&#39;s language and consistently translated its ideologies into sculptural forms. A Jewish immigrant, Lipchitz arrived in Paris in 1909 where he established himself as one of the capital&#39;s most successful avant-garde artists. The threat of Hitler&#39;s troops prompted Lipchitz to move to America in 1941, where he stayed until his death in 1973, successfully rebuilt his career and became recognised as the grand old man of Cubism. Little has been written on Lipchitz&#39;s career as a whole, but this work, published to accompany a gift of 40 sculptures to the Courtauld Gallery, London, sets out to redress this. Cathy Putz presents a thorough analysis of the sculptor&#39;s career illustrated with 80 colour images and numerous archival photographs, some of which have never been seen before.</p><p>Catherine Putz, Exhibitions Coordinator, Tate Britain, UK. Dr Putz has edited and translated a selection of Lipchitz&#x2019;s correspondence (privately printed) and contributed several articles on Lipchitz to recent exhibition catalogues.Putze (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum) presents a substantial, detailed, yet accessible overview of the career of Jacques Lipchitz (1891-1973). Born in Russia, the Jewish sculptor emigrated to Paris in 1909, where he established his fame, taking Cubism into three dimensions. After escaping to the United States in 1941, the continued his successful career, with public commissions and, after the war, worldwide recognition. For so small a book the text is substantial and thoughtful, its arguments closely linked to the well-chosen illustrations. Although about a third of the book is devoted to a gift of 40 sculptures to London's Courtauld Gallery in 2002, P tz writes with great empathy and clarity, and her book can serve as a first-rate introduction and overview of Lipchitz's work and his place in 20th-century sculpture. With 80 color images as well as archival photographs, this volume is highly recommended for all audiences.

In his first book, acclaimed musician and journalist Ryan H. Walsh unearths the album's fascinating backstory--along with the untold secrets of the time and place that birthed it: Boston 1968.<br><br>On the 50th anniversary of that tumultuous year, Walsh's book follows a criss-crossing cast of musicians and visionaries, artists and hippie entrepreneurs, from a young Tufts English professor who walks into a job as a host for TV's wildest show (one episode required two sets, each tuned to a different channel) to the mystically inclined owner of radio station WBCN, who believed he was the reincarnation of a scientist from Atlantis. Most penetratingly powerful of all is Mel Lyman, the folk-music star who decided he was God, then controlled the lives of his many followers via acid, astrology, and an underground newspaper called <i>Avatar</i>.<br><br>A mesmerizing group of boldface names pops to life in <i>Astral Weeks</i>: James Brown quells tensions the night after Martin Luther King, Jr. is assassinated; the real-life crimes of the Boston Strangler come to the movie screen via Tony Curtis; Howard Zinn testifies for <i>Avatar</i> in the courtroom. From life-changing concerts and chilling crimes, to acid experiments and film shoots, <i>Astral Weeks</i> is the secret, wild history of a unique time and place.<br><br><b>One of LitHub's 15 Books You Should Read This March</b></p><p>Ryan H. Walsh is a musician and journalist. His culture writing has appeared in the <i>Boston Globe, Vice</i>, and <i>Boston Magazine</i>. He was a finalist for the Missouri School of Journalism's City and Regional Magazine Award for his feature on Van Morrison's year in Boston, from which this book developed.

The band won a Boston Music Award for Best Rock Artist, and Walsh has twice won the award for Best Video Direction. He lives in Boston with his wife, the acclaimed singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler.&#x201c;One of the finest books written about Boston. . . . Walsh weaves the stories of luminaries who had crucial experiences in Boston&#x2014;Morrison, Lou Reed, Timothy Leary, James Brown&#x2014;around the forgotten and often astonishing history of the city when it was old, weird, and grimy.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Boston M</i>agazine</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>Astral Weeks</i> unearths the time and place behind the music. . . . A book full of discoveries. . . . A fantastic chronicle.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Rolling Stone</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Many a writer has aimed to unlock the mystery of Van Morrison&#x2019;s abstract, early masterpiece, <i>Astral Weeks</i>. But no one before Ryan Walsh thought to center the investigation in the time and place of the album&#x2019;s inspiration: Boston&#x2019;s teeming music scene in 1968. . . . The result must be read to be believed.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Billboard</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Ryan H. Walsh&#x2019;s new book, <i>Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968</i>, takes up Morrison&#x2019;s sui-generis masterpiece and unearths the largely forgotten context from which it emerged. . . . In documenting the milieu out of which the album came, Walsh also argues for Boston as an underappreciated hub of late-sixties radicalism, artistic invention, and social experimentation. The result is a complex, inquisitive, and satisfying book that illuminates and explicates the origins of <i>Astral Weeks</i> without diminishing the album&#x2019;s otherworldly aura.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Jon Michaud, NewYorker.com</b><br><br>&#x201c;Wonderfully oddball.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Astral Weeks</i> is a brilliant, beautiful tribute to a long-lost era of free-form radio, communal living, underground newspapers, burgeoning musical scenes in their pristine form before being captured by the &#x2018;star making machinery,&#x2019; and the birth of a visionary album by a 22-year-old Irish singer/songwriter that remains terrifying in its untouched beauty. . . . This book is a masterful end result of research, patience, and love for a time and sensibility sorely missing today.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>PopMatters</b><br><br>&#x201c;Walsh describes Boston as &#x2018;the true birthplace of American hallucinogenic culture.&#x2019; By the end of his colorful, highly illuminating history of the city's late-60s freak scene, it&#x2019;s hard to argue. . . . <i>Astral Weeks</i> is a book worthy of the name.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Uncut</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A &#x2018;secret history&#x2019; of a proud old city caught in the throes of cultural hysteria. . . .

Walsh&#x2019;s voice is casual, his prose accessible, and his humor occasionally eviscerating. . . . <i>Astral Weeks</i> is another right-on-time reminder of how crucial participation is in keeping art and music alive.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Jessica Hopper,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book is rich with details on what was then an incredible fertile time for the arts. . . . Walsh was drawn to write this book because he was so moved, as is anyone with a soul, by what became Morrison&#x2019;s masterpiece. He honors that art with his own.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Charles P. Pierce, <i>Esquire</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Walsh&#x2019;s book recaptures much that might otherwise fade away. . . .

Walsh is a chatty and engaging writer, and his research is impressive. . . . The most compelling reason to read <i>Astral Weeks </i>is not to learn about Van Morrison or his vaunted record. This is a book about the hub of a very weird universe.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The story Walsh has unearthed is so mind-boggling, so full of extraordinary detail and coincidence, and strange, now impossible ambitions, that one can only share in his delight at the sheer improbability of it all. . . . Possibly if you were to spend years investigating a crucial period in the life of your city, you would find stories as good and as rich as these, but even then you would have to have an eye as keen as Walsh&#x2019;s, a nose as sharp, an ear as sensitive and as attuned to the frequency of the times. This is a wonderful book, I think, funny and interesting and completely absorbing, if you have any interest in just about anything this magazine holds dear&#x2014;art, politics, fun, music, chaos.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Nick Hornby, <i>The Believer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A rich evocation of the momentous year when Van Morrison, feeling from the breakup of his R&amp;B band Them, found himself in Boston. . . .

Nomenclature.</p><p>Previous author Sheila Sloane personally Ellen Drake to work on this Fourth Edition to ensure that Sloane&#39;s Medical Word Book maintains its traditional high level of accuracy and reliability. The result is a resource you&#39;ll turn to for correct spellings time and time again.I expanded the use of phonetic spellings, including some eponyms (e.g., Chvostek has three phonetic spellings). I have occasionally included clues for the use of terms to help readers distinguish, for example, between nouns and adjectives (mucus/mucous), common nouns and eponyms (Green, Bar), homonyms (principal/principle), anatomy and pathogen (pediculus/ Pediculus), or anatomical and surgical terms (suture). I have added about 200 nonmedical terms frequently used in medical reports as well as about 90 frequently misspelled English words; most of these appear in General Medical Terms, a few in relevant specialty sections. Irregularly formed plurals are included alphabetically with the notation (plural of...) and also in parentheses following the singular form. Common units of measure are followed by the appropriate abbreviation. These latter two features are not found in most medical spellers. <p>Style has been updated. For example, the possessive has been dropped on eponyms, periods removed from uppercase abbreviations, and spaces have been removed from abbreviations containing an ampersand. When subscripts, superscripts, or special characters are part of a term, an alternative method for transcribing has been included. </p><p>Updating a reference such as this one was a tremendous undertaking. Truthfully, I don&#x2019;t feel I have finished or will ever finish. I&#x2019;m sure Sheila felt the same way.

Jacob Green, a Jewish kid from suburban New Jersey, sits on the stairs during his family's housewarming party, waiting for his father, Abram--charming host, everyone's best friend, and amateur emcee--to introduce him to the crowd. Housewarming parties, <i>Annie Hall</i> parties, and bar mitzvah parties punctuate Jacob's childhood and require command performances by all the Green family members. But when the confetti settles and the drapes are drawn, the affable Abram Green becomes an egotistical tyrant whose emotional rages rupture the lives of his family.<br><br>Jacob doesn't mean to disappoint his father, but he can't help thinking the most unthinkable (and very funny) thoughts about public-school humiliation, Hebrew-school disinclination, and in-home sex education (with the live-in nanny!). If only his mother hadn't started college at thirty-six (and fallen for her psychology professor). If only he were more like his rebellious older brother (suspended from Hebrew school for drawing the rabbi in a threesome with a lobster and a pig). If only Jacob could confront his overbearing father and tell him he doesn't want to sing in synagogue, attend est classes, write the perfect thank-you note, or even live in the same house with Abram Green. But, of course, he can't. That would be unthinkable.<br><br>This self-assured, comic, yet piercing first novel deftly captures the struggle of an imperfect boy trying to become a suitable son.</p><p>Joshua Braff the author of <i>The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green</i>, lives in California with his wife and two children.&nbsp; <br>A witty, sensitive boy observes the darkly humorous goings-on in his Orthodox Jewish family in 1970s New Jersey. Jacob Green idolizes his older brother, Asher, and misses his withdrawn mother, Claire, but his father, the charismatic, tyrannical Abram, dominates the family. At 10, Jacob's unthinkable sin of forgetting to wear his tzitzit to yeshiva sets off an amusing chain of events&#x2014;Asher's scheming to trick the rabbi, the destruction of the rabbi's tzitzit and Jacob's suspension&#x2014;that quickly turns sober when Jacob faces his father's rage. At 13, Jacob lives in a state of anxiety&#x2014;his learning disability and his father's resulting disappointment erode his confidence; Asher withdraws into adolescence; his mother flees the house to pursue a Ph.D. and another man. Jacob would love to rebel (he's got "a father so far up my ass you can see him performing in my pupils"), but mostly he mentally rewrites his bar mitzvah thank-yous as rants and fantasizes about his live-in babysitter, Megan. When Claire and Abram divorce and Megan moves out, Jacob conveys his angst through a series of letters addressed to Megan. By the time he's 15, Jacob is painfully lonely, as he shuttles between his father's oppressiveness and his mother's honeymooning obliviousness. Although Jacob is a likable, funny narrator, his keen observation and vibrant imagination falter under the weight of Abram's presence and Claire's absence. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Instead she argues passionately that looking at such images&#x2014;and learning to <i>see</i> the people in them&#x2014;is an ethically and politically necessary act that connects us to our modern history of violence and probes the human capacity for cruelty. Grappling with critics from Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht to Susan Sontag and the postmoderns&#x2014;and analyzing photographs from such events as the Holocaust, China&#x2019;s Cultural Revolution, and recent terrorist acts&#x2014;Linfield explores the complex connection between photojournalism and the rise of human rights ideals. In the book&#x2019;s concluding section, she examines the indispensable work of Robert Capa, James Nachtwey, and Gilles Peress and asks how photography should respond to the increasingly nihilistic trajectory of modern warfare.A bracing and unsettling book, <i>The Cruel Radiance</i> convincingly demonstrates that if we hope to alleviate political violence, we must first truly understand it&#x2014;and to do that, we must begin to look.</p><p><p></p><b>Susie Linfield</b> has been an editor for <i>American Film</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and the <i>Washington</i><i>Post </i>and has written for a wide range of publications including&nbsp;the <i>Los Angeles</i><i>Times Book Review</i>,the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, <i>Aperture</i>, <i>Dissent</i>, and the <i>Nation</i>. She is associate professor of journalism at New York University, where she directs the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program. <p></p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not enough to say that Susie Linfield looks at photography with fresh eyes. Throughout this book&#x2014;for me, most powerfully when she takes on Nazi extermination camp photographs&#x2014;she sees with a mind unintimidated by fashion, shibboleths, attitude, cliche.&nbsp;She sees behind the pictures she looks at, to their motives, fears, ambitions, and lies.&nbsp;She writes through them.&#x201d; (Greil Marcus)<br><br><p>&#x201c;A profoundly&nbsp;thoughtful account of the role of photojournalism in an irremediably violent world, Linfield&#x2019;s book is as much about conscience and empathy as it is about photography. Examining images from the Spanish Civil War to Rwanda, she accepts no easy, sweeping answers. Rather, with vivid common sense and with painstaking, often abashed humanity, she guides us through the moral minefield where horror meets art, and helps us to see.&#x201d;&#x2014;Claudia Roth Pierpont</p> (Claudia Roth Pierpont)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is a magnificent book. Susie Linfield has a good eye for the photographs and a good head for the politics.

In addition to completing <i>English Traits</i> (1856) and <i>Conduct of Life</i> (1860), Emerson wrote many of the lectures and articles that made up his next book, <i>Society and Solitude</i>. He also contributed often to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> after helping to found that magazine in 1857. Throughout these years he extended his strenuous trips as a lyceum lecturer, crossing and recrossing the frozen Mississippi several times each winter. In Concord, he continued his omnivorous reading, his beloved walks, and his friendships with Alcott, Channing, and Thoreau, but at home or away he saw America's future darkening daily. In 1856, Emerson wrote to his brother William, "But what times are these, &amp; how they make our studies impertinent, &amp; even ourselves the same! I am looking into the map to see where I shall go with my children when Boston &amp; Massachusetts surrender to the slave-trade."</p><p>Influenced by events such as the murder of New England men in bloody Kansas and the assault on Charles Sumner in the U.S. Congress in 1856, by a growing friendship with Theodore Parker, and by John Brown's visits to Concord in 1857 and 1859, Emerson became one of the most notable speakers against slavery. He armed himself for his emergence from the study by marshalling his thoughts on liberty as he would have ranged his thoughts on any other topic. Notebook WO Liberty, rediscovered in the Library of Congress in 1964, collects his ideas on slavery and human liberty. Probably begun in 1854 it contains drafts or records of seven antislavery speeches, including his major antislavery address, "American Slavery," first given in January, 1855. These notebooks and journals bring the philosopher of "the infinitude of the private man" to January 1861 and the brink of war.</p></p><p>The journals from 1854 to 1861 show the ripeness of Emerson&#39;s thought overshadowed by the gravest problem of his time---slavery.Susan Sutton Smith is Assistant Professor of English at the State University of New York College at Oneonta.</p><h2>Calculus: Single Variable</h2><p>Designed for the freshman/sophomore Calculus I-II-III sequence, the eighth edition continues to evolve to fulfill the needs of a changing market by providing flexible solutions to teaching and learning needs of all kinds.

Only a few years earlier, revolutionaries had proclaimed a new era of tolerance, equal justice, and human rights. How and why did the French Revolution&#x2019;s lofty ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity descend into violence and terror?<i></i></p><p><i>The Coming of the Terror</i> <i>in the French Revolution </i>offers a new interpretation of this turning point in world history. Timothy Tackett traces the inexorable emergence of a culture of violence among the Revolution&#x2019;s political elite amid the turbulence of popular uprisings, pervasive subversion, and foreign invasion. Violence was neither a preplanned strategy nor an ideological imperative but rather the consequence of multiple factors of the Revolutionary process itself, including an initial breakdown in authority, the impact of the popular classes, and a cycle of rumors, denunciations, and panic fed by fear&#x2015;fear of counterrevolutionary conspiracies, fear of anarchy, fear of oneself becoming the target of vengeance. To comprehend the coming of the Terror, we must understand the contagion of fear that left the revolutionaries themselves terrorized.</p><p>Tackett recreates the sights, sounds, and emotions of the Revolution through the observations of nearly a hundred men and women who experienced and recorded it firsthand. Penetrating the mentality of Revolutionary elites on the eve of the Terror, he reveals how suspicion and mistrust escalated and helped propel their actions, ultimately consuming them and the Revolution itself.</p></p><p>Timothy Tackett is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Irvine.[A] grippingly written and deeply insightful book. (Robert Zaretsky <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>[A] boldly conceived and important book...This is a thought-provoking book that makes a major contribution to our understanding of terror and political intolerance, and also to the history of emotions more generally. It helps expose the complexity of a revolution that cannot be adequately understood in terms of principles alone. (Alan Forrest <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>With the instincts and passion of an experienced truffle-hunter, Tackett has snuffled his way through dozens of municipal, departmental, and private archives throughout <i>la France profonde </i>in a quest for letters and diaries from the Revolutionary period. He has discovered a hugely valuable hoard of new testimonies by men and women, Parisians and provincials. His focus is on the bourgeois class that drove the Revolution onward, ranging from individuals elected to serve in successive national assemblies, to local officeholders and functionaries, through to the broader pool of literate and vocal private citizens...<i>The Coming of the Terror </i>allows us into this maelstrom of emotion, highlighting individual reactions well beyond the range of historians&#x2019; usual suspects...By refreshing the sources of French Revolutionary history in a way that is likely to prove enduring, and placing his findings within a lively, robust, and up-to-date narrative, Tackett has put all historians of the Revolution in his debt. (Colin Jones <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Drawing on their day-to-day observations, Tackett argues that the revolutionary process fundamentally changed the people who watched and participated in its unfolding. As France careened in just four years from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy to democratic republic and then descended into the Terror, citizens veered too...By attending to the role of emotions in propelling the Terror, Tackett steers a more nuanced course than many previous historians have managed...Imagined terrors, as...Tackett very usefully reminds us, can have even more political potency than real ones. (David A. Bell <i>The Atlantic</i>)<br><br>The work of Timothy Tackett on the French Revolution has made him one of its most influential recent historians. (William Doyle <i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br>Drawing on contemporary accounts, Tackett vividly describes [the events of early 1789], showing how the excitement of political change was muted by fear of chaos...Throughout his book, Tackett shadowboxes with Tocqueville, who argued that the Revolution merely reconstituted the centralization of the old regime. Tackett&#x2019;s more convincing argument is that there was an abrupt disjunction from past structures. (Gavin Jacobson <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>[Tackett] analyzes the <i>mentalit�</i> of those who became &#x2018;terrorists&#x2019; in 18th-century France...In emphasizing weakness and uncertainty instead of fanatical strength as the driving force behind the Terror, ...Tackett...contributes to an important realignment in the study of French history. (Ruth Scurr <i>The Spectator</i>)<br><br>[Tackett] shows how fear engendered by countless disappointments, betrayals, invasion, insurrection, and numbing violence on all sides, especially from the revolution&#x2019;s own militants, progressively turned fervent enthusiasts into conspiracy�-obsessed terrorists. Tackett succeeds brilliantly; his volume is now the starting point for all efforts to understand this episode. (G. P. Cox <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>A wonderful book, a veritable masterpiece. Tackett finds new sources to answer one of the oldest questions about the French Revolution: why did the deputies of the National Assembly put the Terror in place? In a captivating synthesis of the entire Revolution, he captures its drama and emotion, the fluctuating joys, anxieties, and fears of those who lived through unprecedented events. (David Garrioch, author of <i>The Making of Revolutionary Paris</i>)<br><br>Essential reading for anyone interested in how revolutions devolve into terror. Beautifully written, superbly documented, and fair and balanced in its judgments, it will be a landmark of scholarship for decades to come.

How valid is the process? To what extent do the cultural data become artifacts of the interaction between anthropologist and informants? Having first published a more standard ethnographic study about Morocco, Rabinow here describes a series of encounters with his informants in that study, from a French innkeeper clinging to the vestiges of a colonial past, to the rural descendants of a seventeenth-century saint. In a new preface Rabinow considers the thirty-year life of this remarkable book and his own distinguished career.</p><p><b>Paul Rabinow </b>is Professor of Anthropology at University of California, Berkeley.

Soap notes as well as other forms of documentation are discussed throughout. Sections in this book include: Use of Language, Ethical and Legal Considerations ,Clinical Documentation, School System Documentation, and Administrative Documentation. There are also extensive appendices on AOTA Standards of Practice, AOTA Guidelines to Occupational Therapy Documentation, and AOTA Code of Ethics. This book can be used by students to learn about documentation and by clinicians to improve the quality of documentation in the field.</p><p><p> For many years, I wished for a book that could be used by students to learn about documentation, while at the same time be used by clinicians to improve the quality of documentation in the field. Eventually, I realized that I could, and should, write that book. As a college professor, I spend a great deal of time reading written work produced by occupational therapy students. As a peer reviewer, I read client charts that insurance companies are unsure about; the charts that are so poorly written that the insurers cannot decide whether the services are medically necessary and appropriate. </p> <p> For these reasons, I decided to begin the long and challenging task of writing this book. It has taken over three years from the time I started talking about writing it to the actual printing of the book. Federal rules and professional standards changed while I was writing this book, forcing me to revise and add topics as the book evolved. </p> <p> During the process of writing this book, I learned even more about writing. I learned that I write better in the morning than in the afternoon. I learned that I have difficulty knowing when to use the word "that" (refers to a specific object) as opposed to the word "which" (not specific to an object). I learned the difference between "assure" (to convince or to promise) and "ensure" (to make certain). I learned about comma and semicolon placement in sentences. Just because I pause when I speak the sentence out loud does not mean that rules of proper punctuation call for a comma. I learned the difference between a hyphen, an em dash, and an en dash. Finally, I learned to say "finally," instead of "lastly." </p> <p> My hope for this book is that it gets used; that it is not simply put up on a shelf. I want it to be written in, to have pages flagged, and to have the spine well broken from repeated use. Normally, I would be appalled at the vision of food-stained, rumpled pages in a textbook. But I think this book is different. If it retains its original pristine condition, then it hasn't served its reader well. </p></p><h2>Chemistry (MasteringChemistry)</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE: </b>This loose-leaf, three-hole punched version of the textbook gives you the flexibility to take only what you need to class and add your own notes &#x2013; all at an affordable price.

I like the tone, the examples, and the additional images especially. I note that throughout the text there are references to other cultural developments (stories from Ovid serving as inspiration for Shakespeare plots, for example). I like these connections very much. The 'Compare &amp; Contrast' section is potentially more valuable because of the images paired with it, which will give the students a stronger idea of the concept under discussion. I do like the Colosseum/sports arena pairing, which I find useful. The Colosseum is certainly one of Rome's major monuments and the choice of this to connect with modern examples is logical and useful. The separate section is an extension of this comparative theme as a whole, one with a bit more depth. I think it is a positive one; I like it."<br><br>"Despite having read many textbooks on the same topics, I found reading this book pleasurable due to the writing style."</p><h2>Excursions (Writings of Henry D. Thoreau, 20)</h2><p><p><i>Excursions</i> presents texts of nine essays, including some of Henry D. Thoreau's most engaging and popular works, newly edited and based on the most authoritative versions of each. These essays represent Thoreau in many stages of his writing career, ranging from 1842--when he accepted Emerson's commission to review four volumes of botanical and zoological catalogues in an essay that was published in <i>The Dial</i> as "Natural History of Massachusetts"--to 1862, when he prepared "Wild Apples," a lecture he had delivered during the Concord Lyceum's 1859-1860 season, for publication in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> after his death. Three other early meditations on natural history and human nature, "A Winter Walk," "A Walk to Wachusett," and "The Landlord," were originally published in 1842 and 1843. Lively, light pieces, they reveal Thoreau's early use of themes and approaches that recur throughout his work. "A Yankee in Canada," a book-length account of an 1850 trip to Quebec that was published in part in 1853, is a fitting companion to <i>Cape Cod</i> and <i>The Maine Woods</i>, Thoreau's other long accounts of explorations of internal as well as external geography. In the last four essays, "The Succession of Forest Trees" (1860), "Autumnal Tints" (1862), "Walking" (1862), and "Wild Apples" (1862), Thoreau describes natural and philosophical phenomena with a breadth of view and generosity of tone that are characteristic of his mature writing. In their skillful use of precisely observed details to arrive at universal conclusions, these late essays exemplify Transcendental natural history at its best.</p></p><p><p>A choice collection of Thoreau&#x2019;s ruminative nature writing on walking and the beauty of England, in his characteristically wide-ranging and philosophical style.</p>&#39;There was an excellent wisdom in him, proper to a rare class of men, which showed him the material world as a means and symbol... he had in a short life exhausted the capabilities of this world; wherever there is knowledge, wherever there is virtue, wherever there is beauty, he will find a home.&#39; Ralph Waldo Emerson, from his Biographical Sketch A selection of ruminative nature writing on walking and the beauty of New England, here Thoreau&#39;s characteristically wide-ranging and philosophical style offers a multitude of fascinating observations. Excursions presents Thoreau&#39;s most studied and expansive collection of writing on the natural world. An early advocate of conservationism, he discusses here, in mesmerising prose, the complex but essential relationship between man and nature. This edition includes a remarkable Biographical Sketch by Thoreau&#39;s great contemporary and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson. This choice collection of Thoreau&#39;s nature writing includes the essays &#39;The Succession of Forest Trees&#39;, &#39;Walking&#39;, and &#39;Autumnal Tints&#39; - each one an explorative reach into the heart of the natural world. Thoreau&#39;s travels through the woods of New England are not only physical journeys through some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes in America but also spiritual excursions of the mind. Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was an American author, naturalist, transcendentalist, tax resister, development critic, and philosopher. His many publications include such classics as Walden and Civil Disobedience. Jeffrey S. Cramer is Editor of Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition and I to Myself: An Annotated Selection from the Journal of Henry D.

Thanks to its extraordinary realism and drama, it is easily the longest-enduring work of popular fiction in the language. The story, probably based on the Pacific-island ordeal of castaway Alexander Selkirk, was presented by Daniel Defoe as a true account, and is utterly convincing in its topography, action, and character, even three hundred years after its first publication. Robinson Crusoe is a true page-turner: Dr. Samuel Johnson said it was one of only three books he had read that would have been better for being longer.</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>Investment Fables: Exposing the Myths of &#34;Can&#39;t Miss&#34; Investments Strategies</h2><p><p>The truth about 13 of today's most widely touted investment strategies.</p> <ul> <li>10 powerful lessons for every investor </li><li>Overcoming the enduring myths about markets </li><li>High dividend stocks: better and safer than bonds--or not? </li><li>Cheap stocks: cheap for a reason? </li><li>Should you invest in quality?

These stories not only sound persuasive and reasonable but are also backed up by evidence-anecdotal, in some cases, and statistical, in others-that the strategies work. When you try to implement them for your investments, though, you seldom can match their success on paper. All too often, you end up with buyer&#x2019;s remorse, poorer for the experience and promising yourselves that you will not fall for the allure of these stories again. All too often, you forget the lessons of past mistakes and are easy prey for the next big stock story. </p> <p> While there are literally hundreds of schemes to beat the market in circulation, they are all variants of about a dozen basic themes that have been around for as long as there have been stocks to buy and sell. These broad themes are modified, given new names and marketed as new and different investment strategies by salespeople to a new generation of investors. There must be something in these stories that appeals to investor instincts and to human weaknesses- greed, fear and hubris, to name but three-to give them the staying power that they do. This book is an exploration of the appeal of these stories, why so many investors fall for them and fail with them, and what it may take to win with each of them. </p> <p> As you will see, with each story, there is a kernel of truth that makes it believable and a base in financial theory that allows proponents to claim to have a solid rationale. Each chapter begins with an examination of the basis for each investment story and the theory that would justify its adoption. Why bother with the theory? Not only will it give you perspective on what makes each story work, but it will also allow you to identify potential weaknesses with the story. </p> <p> If you have been on the receiving end of one of these investment stories, you probably have also been told of studies that back them up and you are offered evidence of their potency. It should come as no surprise, given the source, that most of these studies give you only a portion of the truth. As you will see in this book, every investment strategy ever devised has succeeded for some periods and with some stocks, but the complete picture requires an assessment of whether it works over long periods and with a wide cross section of stocks. That is why you will see a review of the existing empirical evidence, drawn from both believers and skeptics, on each strategy and some of the potential problems with each. </p> <p> With every investment strategy, investors also grapple with the question of what adopting that strategy will mean in terms of investment choices. If you adopt a strategy of buying "low" PE stocks, you have to judge what represents a low PE ratio and what types of stocks have low PE ratios. If you believe that your best investments are in small companies, you have to decide how to measure the size of companies -sales, market capitalization, etc.-and what level would represent a small company. You will be presented with rules of thumb, that a PE of 8 is cheap or that a company with a market capitalization less than $100 million is small, but these rules of thumb can be dangerous as markets themselves change over time. To provide a frame of reference, this book examines the distribution of various measures- PE, price-to-book ratio and market capitalization, to name a few- across the entire market. This should then allow you to get a sense of differences across the market and to develop portfolio standards. </p> <p> The best test of any strategy is to apply it to the market and to peruse the portfolio that you would have ended up with as a result of following it. This book attempts to do this with each of the broad strategies examined, and you can ask yourself whether you would be comfortable investing in the stocks that make up this portfolio. If you are not, it is a warning sign that this strategy may not be appropriate for you. If you are a careful investor, putting this portfolio under a microscope will allow you to study the strategy for weaknesses and examine what you can do to minimize the damage. </p> <p> It is worth emphasizing what this book is about and what it does not try to do. It is not about promoting or debunking investment strategies, since there are plenty of analysts and brokers who do the former and lots of cynics, many from academia, who do the latter. But it is about providing a full picture of each investment strategy so that you can make your own judgments about what works and what does not. It is not about answering every investment question that has ever been asked; no one can have the foresight to do this. But it is about providing you with the ammunition to ask the right questions when confronted with promoters of these strategies. It is not a book for pessimists who are convinced that picking stocks is an exercise in futility, but it is a book for optimists who want to figure out how to make active strategies pay off and how to use them prudently. It is not about things you cannot and should not do while investing, but it is about things you can and should do as an investor to improve your odds for success. </p> <p> As long as there have been financial markets, there have been mountebanks and frauds luring investors into get-rich schemes that ultimately fail. In the aftermath of these failings, you are often tempted to turn to the courts and to governments to protect you from yourself. The best antidote, though, to an unscrupulous sales pitch about "stocks that cannot lose" or to a "get rich quickly" scheme is a skeptical and informed investor. I hope this book helps you become one. </p> <br> <br></p><h2>And We Are Not Saved</h2><p>A distinguished legal scholar and civil rights activist employs a series of dramatic fables and dialogues to probe the foundations of America&#39;s racial attitudes and raise disturbing questions about the nature of our society.</p><p><b>Derrick Bell</b> is professor of law at the Harvard Law School.In this expansion of a foreword to a 1985 issue of the Harvard Law Review on the Supreme Court, Harvard Law School professor Bell (Race, Racism and American Law, etc.) asserts that although racial equality has been legally affirmed, economic equality after initial gains is retrogressing despite affirmative action. Lack of enforcement of legislation is partly to blame, he maintains, as are problems concerned as much with social class as color, notably self-interest of a dominant white society. Discussing unresolved racial contradictions of the Constitution, still largely responsible, in Bell's view, for racist attitudes, he uses ingenious metaphorical tales to illustrate aspects of racial injustice that still obtain. He charges that whites have benefited more than blacks from civil-rights reforms, citing desegregation of schools and the 14th Amendment and other measures that extend constitutional coverage to all citizens. He suggests the formation of a coalition of disadvantaged blacks and whites, urging that entitlement standards include class as well as racial disadvantage. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS</h2><p>Examines the possible source of HIV, analyzing a number of theories concerning its origins and investigating current scientific inquiries into HIV, AIDS, and the search for a cure.</p><p>For all the devastation and suffering AIDS has caused worldwide, we have devoted surprisingly little attention to its beginnings. Former UN official and BBC correspondent Edward Hooper hopes to find the source of AIDS in <i>The River</i>, a stunningly comprehensive yet deeply engaging scientific history of the disease. Through more than 10 years of research comprising over 600 interviews and untold hours of library work, Hooper has uncovered a complex, interlocking set of stories--of scientific research, of medical assistance to the Third World, of political and economic exigencies that drive the courses of our lives--and brought them together in over 1,000 pages of text, footnotes, references, and illustrations.<p> His thesis, that HIV made the jump from simians to humans via the administration of oral polio vaccine in Africa in the 1950s, is still controversial, but his arguments are powerful, broad, and undeniable--all that is lacking is conclusive proof. Like a good scientist (and, sad to say, unlike any HIV researcher to date), he offers several easy tests of his hypothesis. His tales of brilliant epidemiological deductions, biochemical comparisons, and physiological insights ought to convince the medical establishment that the answer can and should be found, both to help us deal with the current crisis and to keep us from creating new ones of its ilk. In a litigation-weary world, though, it seems that it will take the kind of tireless, impartial research found in <i>The River</i> to show us--and our leaders--that blame should take a back seat to truth when extreme circumstances demand it. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Based on over a decade of research, involving more than 600 interviews and analysis of more than 4,000 scientific texts, The River examines the myriad theories about the origin of the AIDS epidemic--and reaches a stunning and startling conclusion. <p>Since the early nineties, serious HW researchers have been aware that the most common variant of HIV--human immunodeficiency virus--is the direct descendant of an SIV--simian immunodeficiency virus--carried by African chimpanzees. This still leaves, however, the important and puzzling question of how the virus jumped from chimps to humans, which is all the more intriguing because scientists believe that the SIV has existed harmlessly in chimps for thousands of years, but transferred to humans in the middle of the twentieth century. </p><p>At the end of the century, most informed observers believe that only two viable explanations remain for how this might have happened. </p><p>Many doctors and scientists think the transfer was "natural," the result of human/chimp encounters--either from the keeping of chimps as pets, or from hunting and skinning chimps for food. That AIDS appeared only recently is due, they argue, to the massive social changes in Africa over the last few decades, including the large migrations that occurred after World War II and the end of European control of Africa. </p><p>Others, including Edward Hooper, believe it more likely that the transfer was the result of American and European medical interventions in Africa during the 1950s--and specifically the administration of more than a million doses of an experimental oral polio vaccine, some batches of which may have been manufactured from chimp kidneys. Hooper's extensive investigations and interviews in America, Europe, and Africa lead to some remarkable revelations, which include previously unpublished details about where the vaccines were given and the locations of the earliest traces of HIV and AIDS, as revealed by archival blood and tissue samples. The maps of vaccinations and early AIDS cases are extraordinarily similar. </p><p>At the heart of this book is a riveting detective story with frightening implications--including the continued reluctance of the medical and scientific communities to properly investigate the hypothesis that their activities may have inadvertently given birth to the most devastating infectious disease in human history.</p></p><h2>Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering with CD-ROM and OLC Passcode Bind-In Card</h2><p>The fourth edition of <i>Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering</i> provides comprehensive coverage of the principles of electrical, electronic, and electromechanical engineering to non-electrical engineering majors.

The chapters in this book, written by experts on the region, explore topics such as the trade, religion, political culture, art and architecture, and the local non-Greek populations, from the foundation of the first Greek colonies on the North Pontic shores at the end of the seventh and sixth century BCE through the first centuries of the Roman imperial period. This volume closely examines relevant categories of archaeological material, including amphorae, architectural remains, funerary and dedicatory monuments, inscriptions, and burial complexes. Geographically, it encompasses the coastal territories of modern Russia and Ukraine. The Northern Black Sea in Antiquity embraces an inclusive and comparative approach while discussing new archaeological evidence, offering fresh insights into familiar questions, and presenting original interpretations of well-known artifacts.</p><p>Written by a team of experts on the region, each chapter of The Northern Black Sea in Antiquity features a specific topic or theme, such as trade and economy, political culture, art and architecture, and the non-Greek populations of the region, often focusing on a key category of the archaeological material.Valeriya Kozlovskaya was a lecturer at Mount Ida College, Massachusetts.

Precisely how did they live? What were their ties to the natural world around them? In this study, based upon some six years of intensive archeological and geological research at Labras Lake in St. Clair County, Illinois, Richard W. Yerkes interprets a wealth of important new data in a stimulating and original fashion.<br> <br> With a fine-tuned control of the data, Yerkes challenges prevailing theories based on simple classifications of stone tools according to shape or on simple models of diffuse and focal economies. He views environment as a dynamic factor in economic and cultural life, rather than as merely a backdrop to it. Using incident light microscopy, he examines wear patterns on stone tools to determine what activities were performed during each period the site was inhabited&#x2014;the Late Archaic, the Late Woodland, and the Mississippian. As he documents environmental change at Labras Lake, he analyzes plant and animal remains in context to explore diet and seasonal patterns of subsistence and settlement.<br> <br> The result is a more accurate and detailed picture than ever before what prehistoric life on the Mississippi floodplain was like. Yerkes shows how to assess the duration and size of occupations and how to determine where and when true permanent settlements arose. What others call "sedentary encampments" he reveals as sequences of small residental occupations for a narrow range of activities during shorter, seasonal periods. His contribution to the study of the development of sedentism is potentially far-reaching and will interest many North American anthropologists and archeologists.</p></p><p><b>Richard W.

Written by specialists from the ABA Section of Labor and Employment Law's Committee on Alternative Dispute Resolution in Labor and Employment Law, this definitive resource benefits arbitrators, advocates, and scholars. The editors apply authoritative analysis of basic practice and procedure to integrate relevant laws and their impact on dispute resolution, collective bargaining, and related issues. </p><p>The Sixth Edition expands coverage to consider over one hundred new topics and updates the Fifth Edition with hundreds of recent arbitration awards and references to important judicial decisions, academic and professional commentary, administrative agency regulations and opinions, and federal and state legislation. </p><p>Due to the growing importance of public sector arbitration, separate chapters are devoted to federal labor arbitration issues, and state and local arbitration issues. The chapters on "Interpreting Contract Language" and "Evidence" have been thoroughly revised to reflect the trend of modern critical thought concerning issues such as ambiguity in contract interpretation, hearsay, and after-acquired evidence. Changing views on the availability of non-traditional remedies such as attorneys' fees and interest awards are reflected in a new chapter on "Remedies". And, because collective bargaining agreements increasingly incorporate federal and state statutory standards, the Sixth Edition contains an extended treatment of legislative regulations and judicial decisions that bear upon arbitration issues. </p><p>Extensive footnoting, a table of arbitrators, a complete table of arbitration awards, a table of cases, a table of statutory citations, and a helpful index will save you time finding vital information.

Professor Rowe attempts to help the reader find a way through the intricate structure both of individual passages and arguments and of the dialogue as a whole, stressing its intelligibility as a unified work of art and giving equal attention to its literary and philosophical aspects. The notes also aim to provide the kind of help with Plato&#39;s Greek which is needed by comparative beginners in the language, but the commentary is intended for any student, classical scholar, or philosopher with an interest in the close reading of Plato.</p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.Alexander Nehamas is Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University.

He was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in Vietnam and was a member of the elective Society of American Historians.For all the legions of books published on the Vietnam War, none surpasses one of the earliest and most prescient&#x2015;David Halberstam's <i>The Making of a Quagmire</i>. Halberstam's shrewd observations of the complexities of Vietnamese politics and the obstacles the U.S. faced early in achieving its goals deeply inform the entire book. A brilliant study that has lost none of its power despite the history that unfolded after its publication, Halberstam's book deserves to be read again and again. (Ellen Fitzpatrick, Carpenter Professor of History, University of New Hampshire)<br><br>Few journalists did more to educate Americans about the harsh realities of the Vietnam war than David Halberstam. <i>The Making of a Quagmire</i> offers numerous insights into the conflict between the American press and the U.S. government that began in those years and ultimately played a major role in the war. The book is a valuable introduction to Vietnam in the era of John F. Kennedy and Ngo Dinh Diem. (George C. Herring, University of Kentucky)<br><br>As it did in 1965, Halberstam's book will provoke vigorous discussion. Readers will marvel at how the United States allowed itself to be so misled in South Vietnam and will use the book to make connections to more recent events in the Middle East.

In this breakthrough work Holt lays out the foundation for un-schooling as the vital path to self-directed learning and a creative life. <br></p><p>John Holt was a fifth grade teacher who worked in private schools. In 1964, his book How Children Fail created an uproar with his observations that forcing children to learn makes them unnaturally self-conscious about learning and stifles children&#39;s initiative and creativity by making them focus on how to please the teachers and the schools with the answers they will reward best. His subsequent book, How Children Learn (1967), also became widely known. The two are still in print and together they have sold over a million and a half copies and have been translated into over 14 languages. Holt went on to become a visiting lecturer at Harvard and Berkeley, but his tenure at both places was short-lived. Holt did not feel the school establishment was serious about change in the ways he wanted to go, such as changing the relationship of the child to the teacher and the school to the community. In 1985, John Holt died of cancer at the age of 62, having written 10 books that were very influential in the development of the homeschooling and unschooling movements.This book turned my thinking upside down and changed the course of my life&#x2014;it inspired me to let go of my career as a frustrated schoolteacher in favor of exploring and then advocating self-directed learning. As the homeschooling/unschooling population mushrooms, many fine books and other resources become available, but none replaces John Holt's visionary, revolutionary, attentive, and specific work, as radical now as it was 30 years ago. If you haven't read him, good chance you don't fully understand the depth or possibility of our movement. In Instead of Education, Holt addresses a huge question&#x2014;how can people live and work more purposefully? In doing so, he tackles many medium-sized and smaller questions&#x2014;What do schools really teach? What could libraries lend, in addition to books? Why do children seem happy in a particular school in Denmark? Throughout, his writing is&#x2014;as usual&#x2014;simultaneously reverent and scientific.<br> (Grace Llewellyn, author of The Teenage Liberation Handbook)<br><br>Reading this book again, like reading Maria Montessori, fills me with a certain sadness that such clear vision, brilliant insight and profound understanding of the needs of children should have been offered time and again, for so many years, to be so largely ignored. With our schooling situation growing ever more deplorable, the plight of our educationally abused children worsening day by day, Holt&#x2019;s work is more critically needed than ever. He spells out the problem and its solution with such clarity and simplicity that any parent can read him and every parent should. We ignore his prophetic vision at our peril.<br><br> (Joseph Chilton Pearce)<br><br>In Instead of Education ($15.95, Sentient Publications, Boulder, CO) John Holt says that parents must save their children from schools of all kinds because they kill creativity and do a bad job teaching even the basics. In short, this is a book about home schooling, one of the fastest growing trends in the nation. Why? Because the entire educational system in America has been steadily 'dumbed down' since the 1960s. Holt has been a voice of common sense since the 1960s when his first book, How Children Fail, pointed out that you cannot force children to learn anything. Schools, since then, have been straight jackets into which both teachers and students are strapped by mandatory testing and, for seven million children, mind-altering drugs various 'educators' decided these children needed. His new book is packed with great ideas and examples of how to create learning opportunities and environments outside of the established educational structure. This is an important book that every parent should read.<br> (<i>Bookviews.Com</i>)<br><br>John Holt was a prophetic voice in the educational wilderness who vividly explained why our system of schooling often frustrates genuine learning. He made this case quite clearly indeed in his groundbreaking work Instead of Education. It is as radically relevant to the educational challenges of our generation as it was to his.

Alexander Simpkins and Annellen M. Simpkins</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psychology began as the study of thoughts, moods, and emotions&#x2015;the realm of the mind&#x2015;gradually adding findings from neuroscience about the workings of the brain. Current interest in mind-body health and in the biological underpinnings of mental illness is creating new opportunities for therapists to bring brain and mind together in the treatment room.</p><p><i>Neuroscience for Clinicians</i> introduces an elegant new lens not only for understanding the role of the brain in pathology, but also for using this knowledge in therapy, to help the mind by treating the brain. Offering conceptual models and empirical data as well as hands-on techniques and practical guidelines, it describes methods versatile enough to be used by therapists across theoretical orientations. Detailed discussion of neuroplasticity explores the brain&#x2019;s capacity for change and in-depth case studies of anxiety, substance abuse, cognitive problems, and mood disorders demonstrate the mind&#x2019;s ability to alter brain structures during the course of therapy. And the book is written at a comfort level that requires no previous neuroscience background. Featured in the coverage:</p><ul><li>Learning from brain-damaged individuals.</li><li>How neurons think and learn.</li><li>Neuroplasticity and neurogenesis: moment-by-moment change.</li><li>Incorporating the brain into treatment.</li><li>Maximizing the social brain.</li><li>Shifting the nervous system in common disorders.</li><p>Clinicians interested in understanding the brain&#x2019;s interactions with the mind and its role in psychological problems will find <i>Neuroscience for Clinicians</i> stimulating and adaptable to their own approaches to therapy. The book can also enhance neuroscience and biological psychology classes in cognitive science, medical, and psychology departments. </p></ul><p>C. Alexander Simpkins, PHD and Annellen M.

Adorno&#x2019;s critique of German existentialism. As an expression of the Frankfurt school of critical theory, Adorno&#x2019;s critique is a Hegelian-Marxist response to the existential rejection of critical reason. Although this analysis focuses upon twentieth-century German existentialism, especially its post&#x2013;World War II diffusion, the basic concern is its notion of subjectivity. That is, Adorno&#x2019;s critique is itself an attempt to transcend and include in the perspective of critical reason the truth of the existentialist concern for the fundamentalness of human subjectivity.<br><br> Dialectically conceived &#x201c;subjectivity&#x201d; is historically formed and yet not reducible to historical determinations: history subjectivity is reconstructed from the framework of reflective critique in that the limits of constitutive synthesis establish the range of possible experience.</p><p>Theodor W. Adorno (1903-69) taught at Frankfurt, Oxford, and Princeton Universities.

In a narrative <i>tour de force</i>, <b>Louis Crompton</b> chronicles the lives and achievements of homosexual men and women alongside a darker history of persecution, as he compares the Christian West with the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, Arab Spain, imperial China, and pre-Meiji Japan.<br>Ancient Greek culture celebrated same-sex love in history, literature, and art, making high claims for its moral influence. By contrast, Jewish religious leaders in the sixth century B.C.E. branded male homosexuality as a capital offense and, later, blamed it for the destruction of the biblical city of Sodom. When these two traditions collided in Christian Rome during the late empire, the tragic repercussions were felt throughout Europe and the New World.<br>Louis Crompton traces Church-inspired mutilation, torture, and burning of &#x201c;sodomites&#x201d; in sixth-century Byzantium, medieval France, Renaissance Italy, and in Spain under the Inquisition. But Protestant authorities were equally committed to the execution of homosexuals in the Netherlands, Calvin&#x2019;s Geneva, and Georgian England. The root cause was religious superstition, abetted by political ambition and sheer greed. Yet from this cauldron of fears and desires, homoerotic themes surfaced in the art of the Renaissance masters&#x2015;Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Sodoma, Cellini, and Caravaggio&#x2015;often intertwined with Christian motifs. Homosexuality also flourished in the court intrigues of Henry III of France, Queen Christina of Sweden, James I and William III of England, Queen Anne, and Frederick the Great.<br>Anti-homosexual atrocities committed in the West contrast starkly with the more tolerant traditions of pre-modern China and Japan, as revealed in poetry, fiction, and art and in the lives of emperors, shoguns, Buddhist priests, scholars, and actors. In the samurai tradition of Japan, Crompton makes clear, the celebration of same-sex love rivaled that of ancient Greece.<br>Sweeping in scope, elegantly crafted, and lavishly illustrated, <i>Homosexuality and Civilization</i> is a stunning exploration of a rich and terrible past.</p><p>Louis Crompton was Professor of English, Emeritus, at the University of Nebraska.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/CROHOM_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Flowers of the Caribbean</h2><p><p>Anyone visiting the Caribbean for the first time cannot fail to be impressed by the richness and luxuriance of the vegetation.

Shuy analyzes the role that language plays in bribery cases. He describes twelve court cases for which he served as an expert witness or consultant and explains the issues at stake in each of these cases, for both lawyers and linguists. The cases described include the bribery or alleged bribery of United States senators, congressmen, judges, businessmen, and brothel owners. Shuy describes the often-unused linguistic analytical tools that are available to both the prosecution and defense as they argue these cases. He illustrates how grammatical referencing, speech acts, discourse structure, framing, conveyed meaning, and intentionality can be useful, describing how these tools affected the outcomes of the particular cases discussed in this book. The cases, fascinating in their own right, offer valuable insights not only to linguists, but also to lawyers who argue bribery cases, many of whom may not be aware of the linguistic tools available to them.<br></p><p><br><strong>Roger W. Shuy </strong>is Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at Georgetown University and the author of ten books on language and law. Over the years has consulted on some 600 civil and criminal law cases and has testified at many federal, state trials as well as at the International Criminal Tribunal and before the US Congress on impeachment hearings.<br></p><h2>Exam 77-420 Microsoft Excel 2013</h2><p><p>This <b>Microsoft Excel 2013, Exam 77-420</b> book is the only Microsoft Official Academic Course (MOAC) textbook.&nbsp; This series includes a complete classroom instructional program.&nbsp; This Excel 2013 text is mapped to the Excel 2013 certification exam objectives and is designed to re-enforce workforce skills.

Ranging from Arabia to India and Southeast Asia, Engseng Ho explores the transcultural exchanges&#x2015;in kinship and writing&#x2015;that enabled Hadrami Yemeni descendants of the Muslim prophet Muhammad to become locals in each of the three regions yet remain cosmopolitans with vital connections across the ocean. At home throughout the Indian Ocean, diasporic Hadramis engaged European empires in surprising ways across its breadth, beyond the usual territorial confines of colonizer and colonized. A work of both anthropology and history, this book brilliantly demonstrates how the emerging fields of world history and transcultural studies are coming together to provide groundbreaking ways of studying religion, diaspora, and empire. <br><br>Ho interprets biographies, family histories, chronicles, pilgrimage manuals and religious law as the unified literary output of a diaspora that hybridizes both texts and persons within a genealogy of Prophetic descent. By using anthropological concepts to read Islamic texts in Arabic and Malay, he demonstrates the existence of a hitherto unidentified canon of diasporic literature. His supple conceptual framework and innovative use of documentary and field evidence are elegantly combined to present a vision of this vital world region beyond the histories of trade and European empire.</p><p><b>Engseng Ho</b> is Frederick S.

From this perspective, the aim of true education is to help our children activate this deepest center in themselves. For this, living, intuitive thinking must be brought to life in a new way. The organ for such thinking is the heart, where will and feeling join in uniting self and world, morality and truth, love and action. <br><br> This book is in three parts. The first poses the problem; the second describes the Waldorf approach as a solution; and the third deals with questions of special interest to parents and educators alike, such as authority, discipline, and freedom; the nature of "genius"; and the question of cultural pluralism. <br><br> The first edition of this book was titled "The Experience of Knowledge" in response to a clear call for experience in education. Certainly, if the sole purpose of education is to acquire information, learning becomes dry, abstract, and deadening. To have meaningful consequence in a person's life, "coming to know" must become an experience. Too often, however, such experience is understood simply as doing - field trips, class projects, and so on. But "doing," if unconnected to the whole person, is just activity. To become true experience, it must speak out of, and toward, a student's secret center: the spirit. Hence, the author affirms that authentic education is always in search of the spirit.</p><p><b>John Fentress Gardner</b> worked in anthroposophy and Waldorf education for almost sixty years.

As Runciman says in his preface, &#39;The politics of the Moslem world in the early twelfth-century defy straightforward analysis, but they must be understood if we are to understand the establishment of the Crusader states and the later causes of the recovery of Islam ... The main theme in this volume is warfare ...

Such deprivations have recurred throughout history, and the law sustains these terrors and banishments even as it upholds the civil order. Examining such troubling cases, The Law Is a White Dog tackles key societal questions: How does the law construct our identities? How do its rules and sanctions make or unmake persons? And how do the supposedly rational claims of the law define marginal entities, both natural and supernatural, including ghosts, dogs, slaves, terrorist suspects, and felons? Reading the language, allusions, and symbols of legal discourse, and bridging distinctions between the human and nonhuman, Colin Dayan looks at how the law disfigures individuals and animals, and how slavery, punishment, and torture create unforeseen effects in our daily lives.Moving seamlessly across genres and disciplines, Dayan considers legal practices and spiritual beliefs from medieval England, the North American colonies, and the Caribbean that have survived in our legal discourse, and she explores the civil deaths of felons and slaves through lawful repression. Tracing the legacy of slavery in the United States in the structures of the contemporary American prison system and in the administrative detention of ghostly supermax facilities, she also demonstrates how contemporary jurisprudence regarding cruel and unusual punishment prepared the way for abuses in Abu Ghraib and Guant�namo.Using conventional historical and legal sources to answer unconventional questions, The Law Is a White Dog illuminates stark truths about civil society's ability to marginalize, exclude, and dehumanize.<br></p><p><p>"In language that is searing and lyrical, evocative and precise, this exceptional book<i>thinks with</i> the zombies, specters, felons, slaves, dogs, cadavers, and other entities that are the remnants of loss and dispossession in the law. Dogs and people are abundantly present here, even as the legal fictions they are made to inhabit are exposed with acid lucidity. These are hard histories made readable by Dayan's precious acts of writing."<b>--Donna J. Haraway, author of<i>When Species Meet</i></b></p><p>"Colin Dayan's engagement with what she calls the sorcery of the law leads her to trouble narrative movements from ignorance to knowledge, animality to humanity, barbarism to enlightenment, slavery to freedom. In the process she urges us to recognize how legal technologies that once sustained a core contradiction of slavery--that slaves were only accorded legal personality when they committed a crime--now relegate millions of incarcerated persons to civil death.<i>The Law is a White Dog</i> compels us to acknowledge how the ghosts of slavery continue to animate institutions--from Guantanamo to the supermax--that thrive on racialized violence today."<b>--Angela Y. Davis, professor emerita, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>"This is truly an extraordinary book, one which will become a classic of interdisciplinary legal scholarship.

By the author of Nathan&#39;s Run and At All Costs. Reprint.</p><p>Author John Gilstrap's last thriller, <i>Nathan's Run</i>, was a fast-paced, deftly plotted tour de force about a kid in trouble. In his newest, the author serves up another child-in-danger plot, not quite as scary but touching a more sentimental nerve. Bobby and Susan Martin are still grieving the stillborn son who represented their five-year dream of a family of their own. When a frightened toddler escapes from his kidnappers and plunges into the clearing in the West Virginia mountains where the Martins have pitched their camp, he seems to Susan like the answer to her prayers. And when Bobby shoots the man pursuing the little boy, what seemed at first like a justifiable homicide turns into a nightmare; the pursuer is a cop. Bobby wants to surrender himself and the silent child to the authorities, but after several failed pregnancies, Susan is less willing to give up the boy she almost immediately names Steven, after her dead son. Meanwhile, April, the boy's mother, learns he was taken to satisfy a gambling debt incurred by her ne'er-do-well husband. Gilstrap deftly sets April's search in motion, taking her into a criminal underworld of drugs, extortion, and murder and setting up a heart-tugging situation in which the reader isn't sure whom to root for--the child's real mother, trapped by circumstances, or Susan Martin, who'll do anything to keep him. This explosive thriller ends in a hail of bullets, a climax well worth waiting for after a page-turning read that should earn its author a following of new fans. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Bundled tightly against the cold, the young couple lay on an outcropping over the Catoctin River, looking up at the cloudless sky, and wondering which of the countless millions of stars was truly the one that delivered wishes. </p><p> "You asleep?" Bobby whispered. </p><p> "Not yet." Susan's throat still sounded thick. </p><p> He pulled his bride of five years even closer and kissed the top of her head. "Happy anniversary." </p><p> Susan snuggled in, burying her face in his jacket. </p><p> The calendar had lied. After such a brutal winter, he liked to think that April would have brought warmer temperatures. Out here in the mountains, though, where West Virginia reached closest to God, the air still smelled of February. He'd never been so ready for spring. </p><p> This wasn't at all how he'd planned it. The spot was perfect, yes; and the night beautiful, but he'd hoped the sadness would have dulled by now. There had to be a way to make the pain go away. There had to be. If he were a better husband, he'd know what it was. Susan's thick brown hair -- invisible in the darkness -- felt warm and soft against his hand as he gently massaged lazy circles on her scalp. She liked it when he did that. </p><p> "We'll just try again," he whispered, hoping she didn't hear the tremor in his voice. "And again, if we have to. And again and again and again." </p><p> Susan just burrowed her head deeper. Her anguish felt like razor blades in Bobby's gut. He pursed his lips and stared at the sky, desperately trying to hide the little hitch in his breathing. His role required strength. If she sensed that dimples had formed in his armor of optimism, he wasn't sure how either of them would hold up. </p><p> They'd come so <i>close</i> last time; they'd let themselves believe. As much as he craved children, Bobby wasn't sure he could handle the cycle of hope and disaster anymore. He wasn't sure that anyone could. His tear tracks turned cold quickly in the night air. </p><p> It had been a week since the doctor had pronounced Susan's internal plumbing to be healthy and normal, and this was to be their weekend of healing. The tears were all a part of it, he supposed, as was the pain, but he worried about the anger. Sometimes when he was alone -- only when he was alone -- he raged about the injustice of it all, cursing God and Susan and himself for denying them the one blessing that would make their marriage whole. The anger ate at him sometimes, and on nights like these, as his best friend succumbed to wave after wave of grief, he wanted to hurt something just to exorcise the rage. </p><p> Time was the answer. He knew this, both from experience and from the advice of others, but it was the one element in the world that he could not manufacture. </p><p> <i>Time heals all wounds.</i> What a crock. </p><p> The river ran fast and loud just below them, swollen by melting snows. Every now and then, a few drops would rain down on them from an errant eddy that had slapped against the vertical face of their rock ledge. The thunderous noise of the water filled the void of the night, bringing to Bobby a momentary glimpse of the peace he'd hoped they'd find out here. What is it about water, he wondered, that settles the soul? </p><p> On a different night, he might never have heard the rustling in the bushes that bordered their secluded outcropping. It was a tentative sound, too random to be the wind, but bigger than a coon or a possum. Out in these parts, there was only one reasonable thought when you heard a sound like that. </p><p> "Oh, my God, it's a bear," Susan breathed, speaking their common fear. And it stood between them and their campsite. </p><p> Bobby was way ahead of her. Rolling quietly to his side, and then onto his feet, he rose slowly. </p><p> "What are you doing?" </p><p> "I'm gonna scare him off," he said. </p><p> "You're gonna <i>piss</i> him off. Just be still." </p><p> Bobby had never actually encountered a bear in the woods, but the common wisdom agreed that they had no real interest in people. As long as they didn't feel cornered, and their cubs weren't in jeopardy, they'd much rather run away from a noisy human than face him down. </p><p> "Go on!" Bobby shouted at the top of his voice, waving his arms. "Get out of here! I see you there in the bushes! Get out! Run away!" </p><p> Susan pulled at his pant leg. "Bobby!" </p><p> As the rustling stopped, Bobby turned in the cold moonlight and flashed a grin. "See?" </p><p> Then it charged. Squealing like a frightened pig, the beast bolted out of the trees, coming straight toward Bobby at first, then breaking off to the right, across the rocks toward the river. </p><p> Only it wasn't a bear. </p><p> "Oh my God!" Susan yelled. "It's a little boy!" </p><p> And he was scared to death. Screaming, he ran in a blind panic toward the edge of the rocks, and the roiling waters below. </p><p> "No!" Bobby shouted, and took off after him. "No! Don't! Come back!" But the kid moved like a water bug, darting with amazing speed but no visible effort, turning at the last possible instant away from the water, and back toward the woods, screaming the whole way. </p><p> "I didn't mean it!" Bobby called. "Stop! Really! I didn't mean it!" His words only seemed to make the boy move faster. </p><p> Finally, an old-growth oak tree ended the footrace. The boy looked over his shoulder long enough to see if Bobby was closing in on him, and he slammed into it; a glancing blow on his shoulder that might have killed him if he'd hit it head-on, but instead sent him ricocheting into a sapling, then onto the hard ground. </p><p> Bobby closed the distance in eight strides. </p><p> At first the little boy just sat there, stunned, and then the pain kicked in and he started to cry -- a wailing sound that went beyond pain, combining fear and anger and frustration. He simply gave himself up to it, rolling over onto his tummy and sobbing into the leaves on the ground. </p><p> Bobby just stood there. He had no idea what to do. He stooped down and hesitantly reached out a comforting hand. "Hey, kid, settle down, okay? I didn't mean any harm." </p><p> "Here, let me in." Susan shouldered Bobby out of the way and scooped the boy into her arms. He fought at first, but then he looked into Susan's face, and he liked whatever he saw. He seemed to meld with her, clamping down hard with his arms and legs, his face burrowed into her shoulder. </p><p> Susan shot a look to Bobby, but he didn't know what to say. The boy looked tiny -- maybe three years old -- and he was filthy. Dirt caked his hair and his ears; his skin was crusty with it. He wore only a pair of footy pajamas, with little red choo-choo trains stenciled on the flannel. The toes on his left foot protruded through the tattered cloth. </p><p> "What do you think?" Bobby whispered. </p><p> "I don't know. He's so small. And he's freezing. You should feel him tremble." </p><p> Bobby looked around, hoping to see a terrified parent somewhere, but all he saw were woods and sky and water. </p><p> "Hey, little guy, what's your name?" </p><p> The sound of Bobby's voice made the boy cringe and pull himself even tighter against Susan. </p><p> "He's going to break my back," she grunted. </p><p> Bobby stripped off his down jacket and wrapped it around the boy's shoulders. "Here you go, tiger. Let's get you warm." To Susan, Bobby added, "Let's get back to camp." </p><p> During the walk back, Susan tried to talk to the boy, asking him his name, and how old he was, but all he'd do was cry and hang on. </p><p> "This is bad, Bobby," she said softly. "What's he doing out here without clothes in this kind of cold?" </p><p> Bobby shrugged. "Maybe he wandered away from his campsite." What else could it be? </p><p> "But how did he get so dirty? I mean, look at him. This isn't just a little dirt. This is weeks of dirt. Months, maybe, and even then, he'd have to live in a garden." </p><p> She had a point. There's dirt, and then there's <i>dirt.</i> This kid looked as if he'd been rolled in mud. </p><p> In two minutes, they were back at their campsite, such as it was. Primitive was the name of the game here. Their Explorer was parked a good mile away, at the bottom of the trail. What little they had in the way of creature comforts they'd packed in on their backs. The campfire, built for aesthetics and warmth rather than cooking, had burned down to a pile of shimmering red embers. </p><p> "I'll build this back up," Bobby said, peeling off from the others. </p><p> Susan went straight to their igloo-like dome tent, and the warmth of the sleeping bags inside. She stooped to her haunches outside the little doorway and tried to pry the boy's hands from around her neck, and his feet from around her waist. He grunted and instantly reattached himself. </p><p> "No, no, sweetie, you're okay now. You're safe. We'll make sure you get back home, okay?" </p><p> No, it wasn't okay. It wasn't okay at all. He remained glued to her, and the more she tried to pry him away, the more desperate he became to hang on. </p><p> "Why don't you sit with him for a while inside, Sue?" Bobby suggested, drawn back to the tent by the noise. "Wrap him up in a sleeping bag and just hold him until he settles down. He must be scared to death." </p><p> "Then what?" </p><p> Bobby's eyebrows twisted. "I don't know. I guess we hike out with him in the morning and take him to the ranger station. They'll decide what to do with him from there." Bobby stayed in the doorway for a moment, watching the two of them settle into a sleeping bag. "Tell you what," he proposed after they were lying down. "Why don't I make some hot chocolate? If nothing else, maybe it will loosen his tongue a bit." </p><p> At the sound of the phrase hot chocolate the kid's eyes lit up, but as soon as Bobby shifted his gaze to meet them, the boy quickly looked away and remelded with Sue. </p><p> Having put the cooking equipment away hours ago, Bobby had to reassemble it all from scratch. The camp stove was a single-burner job, fueled with white gas, and it took all of about three minutes to put it together, the satisfying blue flame telling him that he'd done it correctly. He poured water from his canteen into an aluminum pot, put it on the burner, and set about the business of resuscitating the campfire. He carefully stacked what remained of the kindling they'd collected in the daylight and knelt low, so that his elbows were on the ground, and his face nearly touched the dirt. From there he blew on the embers, a thin stream of air that made them flare orange before finally blossoming into a satisfying yellow flame. </p><p> He added larger pieces of wood, and within minutes, it burned freely, the flames reaching a good foot above the pile of sticks. </p><p> This whole thing had him spooked. Why in the world would a toddler be wandering around the woods in his pajamas? If he'd indeed been separated from his parents, where were the teams of rangers and police that should be out here looking for him? Where were the helicopters and the dogs? A sense of foreboding prickled his skin and he found himself obsessed with the notion that someone was watching him. </p><p> A loud snap drew his attention up ahead and to the right, toward the darkness that lay beyond the illuminated circle cast by the campfire. What was that? Most likely, just his imagination. </p><p> But he heard it again. Whatever it was -- whoever it was -- was approaching cautiously. Bobby closed his hand around a club-sized piece of firewood and stood casually, keeping it hidden as best he could behind his leg as he moved to the edge of the light circle. </p><p> "Bobby?" Susan asked from inside the tent. "Is something wrong?" </p><p> "Shh. I don't know. Be quiet for a second." </p><p> There it was again, only this time a rustle of leaves preceded the snap, and again the movement stopped, as if someone were attempting a stealthy approach and getting frustrated. </p><p> "Hello?" Bobby yelled. His words seemed five times louder in the silence of the night. "Who's out there?" </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2001 by John Gilstrap</p></p><h2>Understanding Textiles</h2><p>This&nbsp;book helps&nbsp;readers <i>understand </i>how the components of textiles&#x2013;fiber, yarn, fabric, dye, and finish&#x2013;contribute to the performance of products for specific end uses.

Certain basic concepts are presented in a clear, logically developed format.PREFACE <p> The purpose of this book is to provide a common background for students who are making a study of textiles. Some students may be planning to enter one of the many career areas that require some knowledge about textiles. Others may be interested in becoming better-informed consumers. Whatever may motivate students to enter an introductory course in textiles, certain basic concepts are essential to their understanding of the subject. It is our hope that these concepts are presented in a clear, logically developed format. </p><p> The text begins with an overview of the textile industry. The majority of students are likely to begin their study of textiles without any prior knowledge of the origin, manufacture, and distribution of the wide variety of textile products they use daily. The first chapter presents an overview of the journey of textile products that begins with fiber production and goes on to manufacture of yarns or other components, to fabric production, to design, and to manufacture of the final product. It is our intention to set a context for the chapters that follow in which basic processes, rooted in science and technology, are explored in depth, beginning with the basic building blocks of fabrics: fibers. In subsequent chapters emphasis is placed on the interrelationships of fibers, yarns, fabric constructions, dyes, and finishes. What is known about each of these components is applied to the understanding of textile behavior and performance. The chapters build on each other, much as the textile structure itself is built, and summaries at various stages in the text review the properties that affect performance. We reinforce this view of analyzing component parts of a textile by case studies of particular end use products. </p><p> Diagrams and photographs have been selected with care to illustrate the concepts and processes described in the text. Many students study in parts of the country where they have no access to field trips to textile manufacturing sites; therefore, we have included photographs of various types of machinery. </p><p> Each chapter includes review questions that invite students to summarize and apply the concepts presented in the text. </p><p> The recommended readings at the end of each chapter have been selected to complement the subject matter of the chapters. We have made a conscious effort to include both relatively elementary and highly technical material so as to introduce students to the variety of resources in the field. We have also tried to include readings from the most widely used periodicals in the field. An extensive bibliography, broken down under special subject headings, appears at the end of the book. </p><p> After chapter 1 introduces the reader to the various elements from which textiles .are made, their historical development, and the present-day organization of the textile industry, chapter 2, a combination of the second and third chapters of the last edition, establishes the relationship of fiber properties to fiber behavior. It includes the chemical and physical concepts basic to understanding the behavior of textile fibers, and is written for the reader who has had little previous chemistry training. Students should be able to gain some understanding of these elementary concepts and to appreciate not only the integral role that chemistry plays in the manufacture and finishing of textile products but also the role of chemistry in the use and care of textiles by consumers. Often this kind of material is integrated into varying parts of a text. We have not done so here because a separate chapter on the subjects offers a better opportunity to explain elementary chemical and physical terminology and concepts and to relate these concepts to the science of textiles in later discussions. Some instructors may prefer to emphasize this chapter a great deal, whereas others may wish to discuss it only briefly. Either approach may be taken, and the chapter is divided into three parts to enable further flexibility in assigning the material. </p><p> The chapters on textile fibers (chapters 3 to 12) begin with the natural fibers (chapters 3 and 4). Cellulosic fibers are discussed first because they are simpler in structure than the protein fibers and because cotton is so widely used. Protein fibers, with emphasis on wool and silk, follow. In chapter 5 we introduce important concepts about manufactured fibers, after which we review manufactured cellulosic fibers in chapter 6. Chapters 7 to 12 cover related groups of manufactured fibers. </p><p> Chapters about fibers are all organized in the same way, with many of the topic headings being repeated in each chapter. These topic headings are also used in chapter 2, "Textile Fibers and Their Properties," in order to facilitate comparisons between fibers. Some common brand names of manufactured fibers that are produced under a number of trademarks are mentioned. As companies merge and change products, trademarks become outdated. Readers can keep current through obtaining information on the Internet. Each chapter ends with a table summarizing some of the more important characteristics of the major fiber groups discussed. </p><p> From fibers the text moves to yarns and their production (chapter 13), and then discusses fabric structures. Those who have used previous editions of this text will note that chapters dealing with fabric manufacture have been reorganized, with weaving and woven fabrics separated into two chapters (14 and 15), followed by chapter 16 on knitted fabrics. The chapter on nonwovens from previous editions (now chapter 17) has been renamed "Other Fabric Construction Methods" because not all the fabrics discussed are classified as nonwovens. Chapter 19, on multicomponent fabrics, concludes the presentation of fabric construction methods. </p><p> For both yarns and fabrics, summaries in the chapters show how fiber, yarn, and fabric construction contribute to the total structure of the fabric and how the structure of the fabric is in turn related to its performance. Performance factors affecting durability, appearance, and comfort are discussed. The intent is to enable readers to begin to put together the parts of a textile product and think in terms of end use properties. Examples of specific end uses are presented as case studies under the heading "Putting It All Together . . . ." </p><p> The various methods of finishing fabrics and adding color and design are discussed in chapters 19 to 23. New to this edition is a chapter 19, devoted to the preparation steps that fabrics undergo before being dyed and finished. Chapter 24, "The Care of Textile Products," is entirely devoted to the care of textiles, even though some material on this subject appears in preceding chapters. This chapter is important because of the importance of care in relation to consumer satisfaction with textiles. Chapter 25 explores the important topic of "Textiles and the Environment, Health, and Safety." </p><p> Consumer Briefs appear throughout and explore in depth topics of particular interest to consumers. These features include such diverse topics as how to select carpet, developments in manufacture of recycled polyester, washable silk apparel, and ink jet printing. </p><p> The final chapter summarizes standard test methods used in the textile industry to evaluate the performance of textile products. Performance is related to specific end uses by additional case studies on sail cloth, outdoor clothing, and automotive textiles. </p><p> Special reference tools within the text are provided in appendices. These include the aforementioned bibliography, a glossary of terms (many from the Annual Book of ASTM Standards), and a summary of textile legislation. </p><p> A Basic Textiles Swatch Kit is available for use in conjunction with this edition of Understanding Textiles. The swatch kit consists of 120 fabric swatches, mounting sheets, a master list with fabric name/description/fiber content, and a three-ring binder. It is available through Textile Fabric Consultants, Inc., PO. Box 111431, Nashville, TN 37222/615-4597510.

The author argues that modern disciples of Progressivism are determined to centralize political control in Washington, D.C., to achieve their goal of an egalitarian national society. Furthermore, he contends, Progressive interpreters of the Constitution subtly distort fundamental principles of the Constitution for the precise purpose of achieving their egalitarian goals. It is in their distrust of self-government and representative institutions that Progressivists advocate, albeit indirectly, an elitist regime based on the power of the Supreme Court&#x2014;or judicial supremacy. </p> <p> Key elements and issues in this transformation of the original republic into an egalitarian mass society are thoroughly examined. </p> <p> <b>George W. Carey</b> is Professor of Government at Georgetown University and editor of The Political Science Reviewer. </p></p><p>George W. Carey was Professor of Government, Georgetown University.<p><b><i>In Defense of the Constitution </i></b>could not appear at a more important moment in American constitutional history. The once merely academic deceit that the Constitution no longer matters has now been accepted by a sizeable portion of the general public. In this collection of thoughtful and thought-provoking essays. Professor Carey proves that such a view is not only false, but politically destructive. With a master's touch, he leads his readers back to the seminal principles which undergird the Constitution and make the great democratic republic possible. This is a work worthy of deep and abiding regard. <i>--</i> Gary L.

Though the Myssari are determined to resurrect the human race, using Ruslan&#x2019;s genetic material, all he wants for himself and his species is oblivion. But then the Myssari make Ruslan an extraordinary offer: In exchange for his cooperation, they will do everything in their considerable power to find the lost home world of his species&#x2014;an all-but-mythical place called Earth&#x2014;and, perhaps, another living human.<br><br> Thus begins an epic journey of adventure, danger, heartbreak, and hope, as Ruslan sets out in search of a place that may no longer exist&#x2014;drawn by the slimmest yet most enduring hope.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Relic</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Relic</i> is a thrilling and thoughtful epic.

He is the author of several <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers and the popular Pip &amp; Flinx novels, as well as novelizations of numerous films, including <i>Transformers, Star Wars, </i>the first three <i>Alien</i> films, and the most recent one, <i>Alien: Covenant</i>. Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona, in a house built of brick that was salvaged from an early-twentieth-century miners&#x2019; brothel. He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.1<br><br>He was the last one.<br><br>The others, the rest, the balance, the remainder: they were all gone now, in their mass and multitudes. Memories and ghosts of memories. No one knew how many of them there had been before they were no more, least of all him. There had been a time when countings were done, but such behaviors belonged not to his time but to others. There had been several such times, he knew. Eras as well as countings.<br><br>First came the Expansion. That was followed by the Consolidation. Then there was the Union, which birthed the Empire, which gave way to the Collapse. After a long, slow climb there came the Reunion. It dissolved into the Second Empire, which was followed by the Interregnum. The Interregnum was long and prosperous and offered, among other things, something new to humankind: time for reflection. It was an age when inherent and inherited stupidity finally surrendered to understanding and common sense, and saw among humans the first firm grasping of those things that really matter. As a result, the Conclave that followed lasted even longer than the Interregnum. It showed what could be done. Humanity spread out and flourished. Did some grand things. Noble things, even.<br><br>But in the end, or perhaps it should be said in The End, it was revealed that the species&#x2019; baser instincts had not, after all, been laid to rest but had merely been slumbering. They reasserted themselves with a vengeance. Human fought human over things that, in the end, mattered little. There was shouting and screaming and cursing. There was slaughter and destruction and aggrandizement.<br><br>Finally, in every sense of the word, there was the Aura Malignance.<br><br>That was when everything began to come apart. As the Conclave disintegrated, the bold and the hopeful and the vainglorious made an attempt at a Third Empire, but the inexorable spread of the plague known as the Aura Malignance had weakened the species to the point where that sort of racial energy could no longer be summoned in quantities sufficient to sustain any kind of functioning organization across the spaces between the stars. Gradually the means to conjoin, and eventually even to communicate, began to fade away.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know if this was due to a forgetting of knowledge or the loss of the rare elements that underlay the necessary technology. Worlds lost contact with worlds. The society of man splintered, then fractured, and before long commenced a long, slow slide toward total collapse. Only this time it was different. This time there was no recovery, no reconsolidation, not even a last desperate reach for Empire.<br><br>On Seraboth, where he was from, society had been slowly crumbling for several hundred years. Everyone thought they were safe from the last of the self-seeking spores, that final folly of human ingenuity that always seems to burn brightest in the service of war. But they weren&#x2019;t. Shards of the self-dispersing, all-pervasive biological weapon arrived, and began to kill. Missing no one, the infection ruptured neural connections in the brain. People who thought they had no more than a bad headache flinched, winced, and collapsed, never to rise again.<br><br>Serabothian scientists, and there were many who were as dedicated as they were competent, worked together across political boundaries. Like all who had tried and perished before them, they could do nothing. The Aura Malignance was too virulent, too mutable, and, most critically, too swiftly spreading. The kind of interworld science that had bolstered the various federations and alliances and empires had degenerated. Not only did the facilities to share and communicate no longer exist; neither did the individuals or intelligent machines that might have had the capacity to find a cure.<br><br>So on Seraboth, as on every other inhabited world, the people began to die. In an earlier time they might have gone down fighting, raging at the futility of their situation, shaking defiant fists at the stars, battling to the last in search of a solution to the problem. Instead, once it was felt that nothing could be done, the only response was a vast cultural sigh and a grim acceptance of the inevitable. People perished in silence and, to a certain extent, in peace. They did not know theirs was among the last of the settled worlds to succumb. He certainly did not know he would be the last of the last, the only one to survive the otherwise all-destroying, fast-moving contagion.<br><br>All of this he knew only because of the aliens. The Myssari were very good to him. They found him wandering, tired and hungry and approaching old age, and immediately set to work to fortify what was left of his bodily processes. When they told him what they knew, that human civilization had long since fallen, that all the many and innumerable of his kin on the dozens of settled worlds were gone&#x2014;cities empty, countrysides returned to the unhindered fecundity of nature, vast space stations drifting in emptiness that were staffed now only by the drifting dead&#x2014;he decided he might as well die, too. But even when all else slips away, the tiny flame that is the urge to survive still flickers in the sole surviving representative of a species.<br><br>So he didn&#x2019;t fight it. He let them fix him up, as much as they could. Their xenologists were accomplished, their surgeons expert, their machines advanced. They could not restore him to youth, of course. The Myssari could repair, rebuild, refresh, but they could not reverse time. Taking into account their limitations and his, by the time they finished their work he felt better than he had in decades. Though to what end he could not imagine. He did not particularly look forward to a twilight career as an artifact, but though confused by what had happened to him he understood that the aliens had done what they had done out of genuine interest. It had taken some time and effort on their part to preserve and extend his life. Could he do less in return than live?<br><br>Thus he became, quietly and with resignation, a living exhibit. Ruslan: the last Homo sapiens.<br><br>There was a time when he had possessed more than one name, but now found he could not remember it. Somewhere in the course of his aimless wanderings on Seraboth, it, like so many other things, had become lost. He could not even recall if &#x201c;Ruslan&#x201d; was a first name, a last, or something else. Not that it mattered. There were no other Ruslans with whom to be confused. There were no others at all.<br><br>One thing in particular about the situation in which he found himself was wonderfully ironic. Humans had spent thousands of years believing they were the only intelligent species&#x2014;or at least the only space-traversing intelligent species&#x2014;in the galaxy. Ultimately they became convinced of it and no longer even bothered to ponder the possibility that there might be others. Human civilization rose and fell, rose and fell, finally falling for the last time, and when only one last solitary wandering soul remained, the aliens arrived. Delicious. And not just the Myssari. According to Anu&#x2019;lex, one of his restorers, there were dozens of intelligent species out there. All thriving and exploring and arguing and advancing and pushing their own particular species-centric agendas. All the while that humankind was rising and falling, it was unknowingly doing so on the empty side of the galaxy, the existence of its prolific and multifarious neighbors masked by distance, their communications obscured by intervening radiation.<br><br>Striving to be a good and grateful artifact, he told the inquisitive Myssari what he could. He helped their linguists decipher the floating photonic files that were present in every city center and information repository on Seraboth. This allowed the aliens to access corollary records on dozens of other now-empty human worlds. While such records differed in matters local, the general sweep of the past many hundreds of years remained the same. The story of the tailless bipeds was a heroic tale with a sad ending. Human history had ever been thus.<br><br>It was too fine a day, he thought, to dwell on what might have been. But he could not help himself.<br><br>Composed of a solidified cocktail of carefully engineered binding molecules, the pedestrian promenade was wide and white, easy on the feet yet impervious to heat, cold, and the weather. There were no vehicles about. In Pe&#x2019;leoek both mass and individual transit ran below ground, pollution-free, out of sight, and, except for an occasional slight humming as a line of capsules passed underfoot, out of hearing. Citizens of all three sexes strolled beneath the intense light of Myssar&#x2019;s sun, the youngest still attached to their birth mothers by the strong, flexible, cartilaginous tube that would keep them under control while supplying them with supplementary nutrition until they reached the age of separation. Ruslan smiled as he watched one mother snap an unresponsive offspring back to her side by contracting her muscular leash.<br><br>Several varieties of short, broad-leafed growths provided shade from the powerful UV rays beating down on the walkway. Shading in hue from pale lavender to deep purple, their upturned leaflike pads were round, flat, and held perfectly parallel to the ground. In bloom now, they put forth flowers of intense crimson that attracted waiflike multi-winged pollinators. The botanical rationale behind their enchanting colors had been explained to him. Like much other information supplied by his hosts, it had already been forgotten. Having to cope with and survive among an entirely alien civilization left little room in his aged and overstuffed mind for such choice bits of information, however enchanting or enlightening they might be.<br><br>A child came up to him. Tube-weened, it was attached to nothing but its own curiosity. If not for the restraint imposed upon their offspring by Myssari parents, Ruslan would have found himself unable to move, so dense would have been the crush of curious youth around him. This one looked to be about halfway along the path to adulthood. The narrow, ribbed skull with its small, bright blue eyes with horizontal pupils gaped up at the peculiar two-legged creature. As a sophisticated city and the capital of its homeworld, Pe&#x2019;leoek saw its share of visiting aliens. This routine influx did nothing to mitigate Ruslan&#x2019;s uniqueness.<br><br>&#x201c;I am a human.&#x201d; Ruslan had long since grown used to preempting inevitable questions.<br><br>The half-adult had no trouble understanding his excellent Myssarian. An adept if not especially enthusiastic student of the language of his saviors, Ruslan had been well coached by tutors both live and inorganic. His fluency had progressed to the point where his speech was colloquial. Ingenuously expecting nothing else, the youngster was eager to converse.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a human?&#x201d;<br><br>Ruslan sighed. &#x201c;I am the last representative of my species. Its sole survivor. A relic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You speak well for a relic.&#x201d; The adolescent regarded the strange biped appraisingly. &#x201c;So if I was to kill you, there would be no more of you?&#x201d;<br><br>There were times when characteristic Myssari directness could diverge from the refreshing to the appalling. Looking on from nearby, Ruslan&#x2019;s friend and minder Kel&#x2019;les appeared as if s&#x2019;he was about to intervene, but Ruslan raised a hand to forestall him. A gesture, he reflected, that was shared among many intelligent species.<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot swear to that. My kind settled a great many worlds. But I am the last that I know of. So, yes, if you were to kill me, then there would be no more of me. Beyond me I cannot say.&#x201d;<br><br>On the other side of the promenade, the half-adult&#x2019;s mother, father, and intermet looked as if they wished they were somewhere else. They were too polite to say anything and too conflicted to intervene physically. In Myssari society curiosity among youth was a trait highly prized. This parental triad did not want to inhibit their offspring. At the same time, they worried that his inquisitiveness might spill over into prying.<br><br>They need not have worried. The youth pondered the peculiar biped&#x2019;s response, then gestured with a three-fingered hand that was one of a trio. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t kill you, then.&#x201d;<br><br>The last human smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very considerate of you. It seems that I&#x2019;m very hard to kill anyway.&#x201d; Opening his eyes wide, he leaned toward the youth. This action was sufficiently startling to cause the youngster to step back. In addition to having evolved small eyes due to the intense light of their sun, the Myssari could not &#x201c;open&#x201d; them in the manner of humans. Their enclosing bony orbits were fixed and inflexible. Turning, the bemused and now slightly frightened youngster loped off on his three legs to rejoin his parents.<br><br>Ruslan straightened. The special slip-on lenses the Myssari had made for him allowed him to move about in Pe&#x2019;leoek in broad daylight without damaging his own large, sensitive eyes, just as the third lung they had grown for him from bits of his own lung tissue enabled him to breathe comfortably in air that was thinner than Seraboth&#x2019;s. The organ lay deflated behind his two normal, larger lungs, expanding and contracting with them in perfect unison only when his body demanded additional air. In the event he found himself once more on a human-settled world, it would not inhibit his normal breathing. Myssari surgeons were very adept.<br><br>Other than the third lung and the artificial lenses that protected his retinas, his body was much as the Myssari had found it. Manufactured to his own suggested design by a local crafts-professional, the broad-brimmed hat he wore protected his head from the strong sunshine better than did his close-clipped gray hair. Finding clothing of any type or style was no problem, nor was anything else he might desire. He could pick and choose from among the miscellany of a hundred worlds. Artifacts to fit the artifact.<br><br>More than once he had grudgingly admitted to himself that his was not a terrible way to finish out one&#x2019;s life. Other than the absence of company of his own kind, he wanted for nothing. The considerate Myssari did not even have to synthesize food for him.

Becker and renowned jurist and legal scholar Richard A. Posner announced the formation of the Becker-Posner Blog.</p><p>In no time, the blog had established a wide readership and reputation as a reliable source of lively, thought-provoking commentary on current events, its pithy and profound weekly essays highlighting the value of economic reasoning when applied to unexpected topics. Uncommon Sense gathers the most important and innovative entries from the blog, arranged by topic, along with updates and even reconsiderations when subsequent events have shed new light on a question. Whether it&#x2019;s Posner making the economic case for the legalization of gay marriage, Becker arguing in favor of the sale of human organs for transplant, or even the pair of scholars vigorously disagreeing about the utility of collective punishment, the writing is always clear, the interplay energetic, and the resulting discussion deeply informed and intellectually substantial.</p><p>To have a single thinker of the stature of a Becker or Posner addressing questions of this nature would make for fascinating reading; to have both, writing and responding to each other, is an exceptionally rare treat. With Uncommon Sense, they invite the adventurous reader to join them on a whirlwind intellectual journey. All they ask is that you leave your preconceptions behind.</p></p><p><p><b>Gary S.

(Elizabeth Taylor <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An excellent book . . . . For anyone who wants a quick and easy crash course on Chicago economics-style thinking, this book is as good as it gets. . . . I read nearly the whole book in one sitting.&#x201d; (Steven D. Levitt <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br><p>"In December 2004, Gary Becker and Judge Richard Posner, two intellectual superstars, created a weekly Internet blog&nbsp; that examines a wide variety of topics with the tools of economics. This book culls from the blog's first 28 months 49 posts that they consider their best, most interesting, and most lasting. Becker and Posner do not persuade by using authority or clever rhetoric--they write in a dry academic style--but they attempt to make a clear, logical case for their positions using economic reasoning. Occasionally they discuss conventional economic topics, but more often they write about broader and more provocative issues such as sex and population, universities, crime and punishment, the environment and disasters, and a miscellany of world problems. Both write on each issue; they usually agree with each other, but not always. The book's primary appeal is that it shows how two first-rate economic thinkers analyze issues. . . . Highly recommended.

Both a calendar of daily rituals and a witty sequence of stories recounted in a variety of styles, it weaves together tales of gods and citizens together to explore Rome&#39;s history, religious beliefs and traditions. It may also be read as a subtle but powerful political manifesto which derides Augustus&#39; attempts to control his subjects by imposing his own mythology upon them: after celebrating the emperor as a Jupiter-on-earth, for example, Ovid deliberately juxtaposes a story showing the king of the gods as a savage rapist. Endlessly playful, this is also a work of integrity and courage, and a superb climax to the life of one of Rome&#39;s greatest writers.</p><p>Book IV of Ovid&#39;s celebration of the calendar and the associated legends of the Roman year treats the month of April, a particularly happy phase of the Augustan ceremonial year. Around the festival of Venus and the anniversary of the foundation of Rome Ovid retells the legends of Rome&#39;s royal found Romulus and the Trojan hero Aeneas. The introduction and commentary pay special attention to Ovid&#39;s art as a poet, but aim to provide both the general background and specific explanations of his historical and religious material.Ovid&#39;s Fasti, begun in or soon after AD I, was to have celebrated the calendar and associated legends of the Roman year, but probably had reached no further than June before his exile in AD 8. Book IV, the book of April, honours the festivals of Venus, Cybele, Ceres and their cult, as well as the traditional date of the foundation of Rome and many religious and civic anniversaries. Elaine Fantham accompanies her commentary with a revised text and a deliberately extended introduction. Besides including surveys of language, style, versification and textual transmission, the introduction looks at the shifting generic traditions of Greek and Roman elegy, and situates Ovid&#39;s composite poem in its Augustan literary and historical context.</p><h2>The Magic Lantern: Having a Ball and Christmas Eve (Library of Latin America)</h2><p>Jos� Tomas de Cu�llar (1830-1894) was a Mexican writer noted for his sharp sense of humor and gift for caricature.&nbsp;<i>Having a Ball</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Christmas Eve</i>&nbsp;are two novellas written in the&nbsp;<i>costumbrista</i> style, made popular in the mid-nineteenth century by the periodical press in which these sketches of contemporary manners were first published.

This Companion is the first collected volume to address all aspects of Wollstonecraft&#39;s momentous and tragically brief career. The diverse and searching essays specially commissioned for this volume do justice to Wollstonecraft&#39;s pivotal importance in her own time and since, paying attention not only to A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, but to the full range of her work.

Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862-1864</h2><p>"I don't know how long before i shall have to go into the field of battle. For my part i don't care. I don't feel afraid to go. I don't believe there are any Rebel's bullet made for me yet."--Pvt. Lyons Wakeman. <br>Similar sentiments were expressed by tens of thousands of Civil War soldiers in their diaries and in their letters to loved ones at home. What transforms the letters of Pvt. Lyons Wakeman from merely interesting reading into a unique and fascinating addition to Civil War literature is who wrote them--for Private Wakeman was not what "he" seemed to be. The five-foot tall soldier's true identity was that of a simple young farm girl from central New York state named Sarah Rosetta Wakeman. Her letters, the only such correspondence known to exist, provide a rare glimpse of what life was like for a woman fighting as a common soldier in the Civil War under the guise of a man.<br> Written shortly after she left home to pursue her fortune in 1862, Rosetta's letters over the next two years tell of army life in the defences of Washington, D.C. and on the march and in battle during the 1864 Louisiana Red River Campaign. She wrote frequently to her family in Afton, NY, and her letters contain feelings and observations like those expressed by the majority of her fellow soldiers. We read of her determination to perform honorably the duty required of a soldier, the trials of hard marching and combat, her pride in being able to "drill just as well as any man" in her regiment, and her eventual fatalistic attitude toward military service, and her frequent expressions of faith in God and the afterlife. Although Rosetta did not survive the war, her letters remain as an singular record of female military life in the ranks, a phenomenon largely ignored by historians and researchers.<br> Private Wakeman was not alone in embarking on her strange adventure. Hundreds of women, from both the North and South, disguised themselves as men and enlisted in the armies of our nation's bloodiest war. The experiences of these women during the Civil War are just beginning to be recognized as elemental to understanding the life of this country during those turbulent times. Little is known about these women precisely because they enlisted and served in constant secrecy, fearful of revealing their true identities. This unique collection of letters offers a firsthand look at the personality and character of a woman who defied convention to take a man's place in the Union army.<br></p><p>Sentiments were expressed by tens of thousands of Civil War soldiers in their diaries and in their letters to loved ones at home.

Author Sobonfu Some, whose name means "keeper of rituals," narrates this collection of stories and traditions from her native tribe--the Dagara of Burkino Faso, Africa. Children are considered the soul of each village, according to the Dagara people, and as a result the tribe has numerous rituals that celebrate the arrival and raising of young ones. Page by page, Some explains these many exotic and loving rituals--from helping grandparents and babies bond to activities that support a "child's sense of worth." Even a woman's conception is cause for enormous community pride. Elders bathe the mother-to-be, dress her up, and then "introduce her and the incoming soul to the community." Everyone kisses her belly and sings songs of welcoming and joy. The tribe's simplistic lifestyle and genuine happiness seem to stem from its strong connection to the earth as well as the honoring of all tribal people--even the unborn.<p> "This is a teacher who can help us put together so many things that our modern Western World has broken," according to jacket quote by Alice Walker. This is, in fact, Some's underlying mission--with the entire back section devoted to how readers can adapt these beautiful Dagara rituals into a Western lifestyle. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p></p><h2>Napoleon on Napoleon: An Autobiography of the Emperor</h2><p>Corner of cover creased, owner&#39;s inscription.

Marc Loudon is a textbook that students will actually <em>want</em> to read. This much-anticipated fourth edition continues its predecessors' popular and unique mechanistic approach within a functional group framework. Enhanced biological and biochemical material makes it ideal for chemistry majors as well as pre-medical and pre-pharmacy students taking a full-year, sophomore- level course. Loudon's excellent use of language and reader-friendly style transform organic chemistry into a logical, understandable, and exciting subject for students.<br> <br> In use at undergraduate and graduate schools of all levels, this authoritative yet accessible volume is packed with effective analogies that enliven and clarify rigorous discussions of important concepts. For example, Loudon uses a flute player jumping between musical octaves to explain transitions between quantum levels. An engaging detective with combined characteristics from Sherlock Holmes and James Bond depicts resonance structures. Thanks to humorous characters like Flick Flaskflinger and Professor Havno Scentz, problem-solving becomes simultaneously challenging and entertaining. Varying from the routine to the complex, Loudon's problems are renowned for their originality, their range of difficulty levels, and their ability to teach students to understand and predict organic reactivity rather than just memorize facts. In addition, Loudon blends biological, environmental, and industrial applications of organic chemistry into the body of the text--rather than separating them as "special topics"--giving students an integrated sense of the subject in its real-life context.<br> <br> <strong> Other Features</strong><br> � Uses a high-resolution 300 MHz spectra run <em>specifically</em> for this text in an easy-to-read format that makes splitting patterns very clear.<br> � Includes new sections on transition-metal organometallic chemistry, reactions of pyridoxal phosphate, combinatorial synthesis, and drug design.<br> � Emphasizes both Bronsted and Lewis acid-base chemistry and their associated curved-arrow notations.<br> � Provides more than 1,500 excellent in-text problems that challenge students to think and analyze rather than just memorize.<br> � Presents "boxed asides" with interesting historical vignettes and analogies that enrich the text.<br> � Utilizes extensive cross-references between important concepts, thus saving students trips to the index.<br> � Supplemented by a CD-ROM--"Dynamic Organic Chemistry"--containing original animations (Mac and Windows compatible).<br></p><p>G.

Although his work is not widely known outside his own country, for twenty years he has been creating unusual structures throughout Japan. He recently received an award from the Japan Institute of Architects as the most outstanding young architect in the country.<p>Takasaki's designs combine the organic and the mythological. He describes his architecture as an "environmental being" that connects humanity with the cosmos. These philosophies manifest themselves in his use of egg-shaped forms, diffused light to create mystical interiors, and skewed columns and planes.</p><p>The eight projects explored in this monograph include Crystal Light in Tokyo, Tamana City Observatory Museum in Kumamoto, Earth Architecture in Tokyo, and Kihoku-cho Astronomical Museum in Kagoshima. Each building is thoroughly described through text, photographs, and drawings. Also included is an illustrated list of the architect's projects and a critical text by Botond Bognar, author of "The Japan Guide".</p></p><p>Experiencing the magical world of Takasaki's architecture evokes the awe that one feels when looking at images taken by the Hubbell Telescope...it is the experience of coming face to face with the infinity and timelessness of the cosmos, the inexplicable and the unexplainable, that is, the dimensions of the unknown and the unknowable. <strong>Botond Bognar, from his introduction to <i>Takasaki Masaharu: An Architecture of Cosmology</i></strong><br><br> Above all, Takasaki's buildings are orchestrated by a gutsy exuberance that celebrates humanity in all its messy complexity and diversity ....

On the other side of the spectrum, academics have studied the Bible using scientific analysis to examine its historical significance and meaning. The gap between these readings has resulted in a schism with far-reaching implications: Without historical context, ordinary people are left to interpret the Bible literally, while academic readings overlook the deeply personal connections established in church pews, choir benches, and backyard study groups.</p><p>In <em>How To Read the Bible</em>, Cox explores three different lenses commonly used to bring the Bible into focus:</p><ul> <li> Literary&#x2014;as narrative stories of family conflict, stirring heroism, and moral dilemmas;</li> <li> History&#x2014;as classic texts with academic and theological applications;</li> <li> Activism&#x2014;as a source of dialogue and engagement to be shared and applied to our lives.</li></ul><p>By bringing these together, Cox shows the Bible in all its rich diversity and meaning and offers us a contemporary activist version that wrestles with issues of feminism, war, homosexuality, and race. The result is a living resource that is perpetually evolving as our understanding changes and deepens from generation to generation.</p></p><p><p>For many people, the Bible lies at the heart of their faith, an ageless source of inspiration and guidance. On the other side of the spectrum, trained biblical scholars study the Bible using a variety of modern historical and literary approaches. But there is a wide gap be-tween these two groups of readers, a gap that brings negative consequences for both. Without an awareness of historical context, ordinary readers easily slip into a literal interpretation, while scholars sometimes overlook the deeply personal significance the Bible has for people in churches, synagogues, and Bible study groups.</p><p>In <em>How to Read the Bible</em>, renowned Harvard Divinity School professor Harvey Cox shows how these different ways of approaching the Bible can be reconciled to the enrichment of all. By discussing a range of biblical books from Genesis to Revelation, he demonstrates how the historical analysis of the Bible, rather than undercutting its spiritual significance, can enhance and deepen it. Drawing on some of the commonly used modes of biblical scholarship, such as archaeology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Cox opens up a rich, diverse, and contemporary version of scripture, one that wrestles with issues of feminism, war, homosexuality, and race. The result is a Bible that is a timeless but contemporary resource for all.</p><p>Harvey Cox is the Hollis Research Professor of Divinity at Harvard University, where he has taught since 1965, both at Harvard Divinity School and in the Harvard Fac- ulty of Arts and Sciences.

It looks at hero cult generally, but focuses especially on heroization in the 5th century B.C. . There are individual chapters on the heroization of war dead, of athletes, and on the religious treatment of the living in the 5th century. Hero cult, Bruno Currie argues, could be anticipated, in different ways, in a person&#39;s lifetime. Epinician poetry too should be interpreted in the light of this cultural context; fundamentally, this genre explores the patron&#39;s religious status.

Under what conditions (if any) is whistle-blowing morally required? These are just some of the questions that scholars as diverse as Michael D. Bayles, Thomas Nagel, Sissela Bok, Jessica Mitford, and Peter A. French confront in this stimulating anthology. Organized around philosophical issues such as the moral foundations of professional ethics, models of the professional-client relationship, deception, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, professional dissent, and professional virtue, the volume illuminates the complex ethical issues that arise in journalism, law, health care, counseling, education, engineering, business, politics, and social science research. A variety of pedagogic aids including clear introductions to and study questions for each set of readings, concrete cases designed to focus discussion, and an appendix on preparing cases and position papers, make the text invaluable for both students and teachers of professional ethics.<br></p><p>Joan C.

By questioning them, this work continues to stimulate a reorientation in our understandiing of Baroque and post-Baroque music.</p></p><p>"This work is not only the definitive book on the subject to date.

But the new regime is poised for victory, and in its brutal triumph lies destruction for the Turbins and their world.<br><br>This novel, Mikhail Bulgakov&#x2019;s literary debut, may in fact have saved the writer, whose works were often censored under the Soviet regime: Stalin was an avid fan of a play based on&nbsp;<i>The White Guard</i>&nbsp;and allegedly went to see it more than fifteen times.

It is set in Kiev during the Russian revolution and tells a story about the war's effect on a middle-class family (not workers). The story was not politically correct and thereby contributed to Bulgakov's lifelong troubles with the Soviet authorities. It was, however, well-loved, and the novel was turned into a successful play at the time of its publication in 1967.MIKHAIL BULGAKOV was born in Kiev on May 15th 1891. He graduated as a doctor but gave up the practice of medicine in 1920 to devote himself to literature. He went on to write some of the greatest novels in twentieth century Russian literature, including&nbsp;<i>The White Guard</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heart of a Dog</i>, and his masterpiece,&nbsp;<i>The Master and Margarita</i>.

In <em>Eurekas and Euphorias</em>, Walter Gratzer captures the human face of discovery as he relates many intriguing tales of scientific adventures spanning over two thousand years. <br> Open this book at random and you may chance on the clumsy chemist named Sapper who broke a thermometer in a reaction vat and made the discovery that launched the modern dyestuff industry. Or the physicist who dissolved his gold Nobel Prize medal in acid to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Nazis. The book uncovers deep intellectual friendships, as well as ferocious animosities, and even acts of theft and malice, deceit, and a hoax or two. Indeed, we discover that scientists come in all shapes--the obsessive and the dilettantish, the genial, the envious, the preternaturally brilliant and the slow-witted who sometimes saw further in the end, the open-minded and the intolerant, recluses and <em>arrivistes</em>. We meet mathematicians and physicists in prison cells, and even in a madhouse, making important advances in their field. And we witness the careers, sometimes tragic, sometimes carefree, of the great women scientists, from Hypatia of Alexandria, to Sophie Germain and Sonia Kovalevskaya, to Marie Curie and her relentless battle with the French Academy.<br> Told with wit and relish, here then is a glorious parade to delight the reader, with stories to astonish, to instruct, and most especially, to entertain.<br></p><p><br><strong>Walter Gratzer</strong> is a biophysicist at the Randall Institute, King's College London. He is known to a wide readership through his book reviews which appear regularly in <em>Nature</em>. His books include <em>The Undergrowth of Science: Delusion, Self-Deception and Human Frailty, Longman Literary Companion to</em> <em>Science</em>, and <em>The Bedside Nature</em>.<br>Sifting through centuries of scientific ephemera, biophysicist Gratzer uncovers what may be the real history of science, revealed not by its formal narratives but by anecdotes of discovery shared over cups of coffee and pints of beer. The resulting collection of almost 200 tales is a browser's delight, an informal history featuring appealing quotes from memoirs, biographies and reports and candid images of scientists at work. Gratzer, author of The Undergrowth of Science, acknowledges that he cannot verify the truth of each account (though he includes extremely reliable sources for most) and cheerfully notes that he includes reports he feels "deserve to be true." Luminaries from polymathic Archimedes, whom Grazter credits with "the first eureka," to Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who attributed his scientific inspiration to a Cornell University dining hall plate, are shown in all their brilliant (and sometimes nasty) humanity. Not surprisingly, many of science's greatest moments turn out to be the result of stereotypical absentmindedness, and Gratzer reports these incidents with affectionate glee. While some of the material is familiar, readers at all levels of scientific literacy will find fresh, witty and sometimes moving glimpses into the reality of scientific endeavor. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mark Twain&#39;s Civil War: The Private History of a Campaign That Failed</h2><p>From the Mark Twain Project comes a freshly informed look at Twain&#x2019;s controversial Civil War story &#x201c;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed.&#x201d; Twenty years after Appomattox, Twain published a highly fictionalized account of his two-week stint in the Confederate Army. Ostensibly this told what he did (or, in his own words, why he &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t do anything&#x201d;) in the war; but the article was criticized as disingenuous, and it did little to address a growing curiosity about the nature of his brief military service. The complex political situation in Missouri during the early months of the war and Twain&#x2019;s genius for transforming life into fiction have tended to obstruct historical understanding of &#x201c;The Private History&#x201d;; interpretations of Samuel Clemens&#x2019;s enthusiastic enlistment, sedulous avoidance of combat, and abandonment of the rebellion have ranged from condemnation to celebration. Aided by Twain&#x2019;s notes and correspondence&#x2015; transcribed and published here for the first time&#x2015;Benjamin Griffin of UC Berkeley&#x2019;s Mark Twain Project offers a new and cogent analysis, particularly of Clemens&#x2019;s multiple revisions of his own war experience.

Carol Pirtle changes that with her investigation into the 1843 suit Andrew Borders lodged against William Hayes, charging his neighbor with helping slaves from the Borders estate escape to Galesburg. In conjunction with her probe into the past, Pirtle also discovered the Hayes correspondence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pirtle documents Hayes&#x2019;s involvement in the Illinois Underground Railroad through approximately two hundred letters received by Hayes from the early 1820s until his death in 1849. Many of these letters specifically corroborate his participation in the escape of slaves from the Borders estate. One such letter came from T. A. Jones in 1843: &#x201c;You Dear Sir are to me an unknown friend, yet I believe you are a friend to the poor down trodden Slave. This is as good an introduction as I want from any man. My brother, our cause is a holy one.&#x201d; Letters written by Galesburg residents show that several prominent citizens of that community also assisted in the affair, proving that Knox College administrators and trustees were active in the Underground Railroad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pirtle also includes excerpts from the trial transcript from the 1844 civil case against Hayes, which was tried in Pinckneyville, Illinois. She researched newspaper accounts of the event, most notably those in the <i>Western Citizen</i> and the<i> Sparta Herald. </i>Records of the Covenanter Presbyterian church of which Hayes was a member provide partial explanations of Hayes&#x2019;s motives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Telling the story of Hayes and his involvement with Susan Richardson and the Underground Railroad, Pirtle provides insight into the work of abolitionists in Illinois. <i>Escape Betwixt Two Suns</i>, in fact, is one of the few books to substantiate the legends of the Underground Railroad. She tells the story of a quiet man who made a difference, of a man deserving the accolades of a hero.</p></p><p><p><b>Carol Pirtle </b>is a professional writer. Her books include <i>Shining Moments<b></b></i>and <i>Where Illinois Began: A Pictorial History of Randolph County.</i></p><p>&#x201c;What is equally arresting about this volume and the sources on which it is based is the description here of activity at both ends of an Underground Railroad transaction: the escape of slaves from their owner, in this case the details of which were not previously known; the response of their owner; litigation initiated by both the owner and by supporters of the fugitives; and in this instance the escapees&#x2019; partially successful guarantee of permanent freedom.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Rodney O.

Today these three gardens - those of the Sento Imperial Palace, the Katsura Detached Palace, and the Shugaku-in Detached Palace - are among the most celebrated in Japanese garden art, and here, for the first time in a book designed for Western readers, their beauty is revealed in striking photography and intimate detail. All of the gardens were designed to a great extent by members of the court; all are much larger than the average Japanese garden; all are stroll gardens in which the visitor is charmed by an almost endless succession of delightful views; and all date from the middle seventeenth century, when the stroll garden emerged into prominence. Emperors and princes, deprived of all political power by the ruling shoguns, turned to artistic pursuits, among them the art of garden design. Today these gardens, reverently preserved and universally admired, stand as monuments to their discriminating taste, outshining all surviving gardens created by the military rulers and their vassals. Through the photographs and the accompanying essays the reader is invited not only to see these gardens in a variety of seasons and moods, but also to have a look at their history and the distinguishing features of their construction and design: the ponds, waterfalls, and streams; the bridges and islands; the teahouses; the steppingstones, paths and lanterns; ornamental rockwork; the trees and shrubbery, but more important than this, it conveys the spirit of the gardens themselves and the aesthetic philosophy that went into their making.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>DK Workbooks: Math, Pre-K: Learn and Explore</h2><p><p>Perfect for preschoolers, this workbook contains exercises that focus on the most basic concepts of math including counting to ten, shapes, money, and reading and writing numbers.</p><p>Developed in consultation with leading educational experts to support curriculum learning, <i>DK Workbooks: Math</i> is an innovative series of home-learning math workbooks that is closely linked to school curriculum and helps make learning easy and fun.</p><p>Each title is packed with exercises and activities to strengthen what children learn in school.

Four Arrows provides a degree of "credibility" that will help graduate students legitimize their ideas in the eyes of more conservative university committees. This inspiring book will also help academics who sincerely want to see these alternative forms but are concerned about the rigor of "alternative" dissertation research and presentation.</p> <p>The featured dissertation stories tap into more diverse perspectives, more authentic experience and reflection, and more creative abilities.

McMurry presents only those subjects needed for a brief course while maintaining the important pedagogical tools commonly found in larger books. With clear explanations, thought-provoking examples, and an innovative vertical format for explaining reaction mechanisms, FUNDAMENTALS takes a modern approach: primary organization is by functional group, beginning with the simple (alkanes) and progressing to the more complex. Within the primary organization, there is also an emphasis on explaining the fundamental mechanistic similarities of reactions. Through this approach, memorization is minimized and understanding is maximized. The sixth edition brings in new content that applies organic chemistry to students, for example all of the chapter openers have been changed and incorporate a model and photograph of an application of organic chemistry such as Taxol from the pacific yew tree. The book introduces a running application in the Interlude boxes and in the problems relating agricultural chemicals intended to unify the subject further for students. All of the problems have been reorganized by topic to make easier to assign and review. New problem categories have been added. The new problem categories are &#34;In the Field with Agrochemicals&#34; and &#34;In the Medicine Cabinet&#34; to reinforce the focus on applications.</p><p>John E. McMurry received his B.A. from Harvard University and his Ph.D. at Columbia University. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an Alfred P.

What does a hypnotherapist actually do on a case-by-case and a session-by-session basis? What specific strategies can be implemented? What are the scope and nature of the challenges that hypnotherapists and their clients face? What interpersonal issues emerge in hypnotherapeutic treatment?<br>The editors of the Casebook of Clinical Hypnosis have marshaled an impressive group of eminent hypnotherapists to consider these issues and to illustrate them with interesting and memorable cases from their own experience. Each chapter is devoted to the explication of clinical techniques and strategies, and many chapters contain transcripts of actual sessions and suggestions administered, thus providing readers with a window onto the world of clinicians' best hypnotherapeutic work with their clients. Contributing therapists offer the presenting background and assessment information of a client, the treatment rationale, the role of hypnosis within the treatment, outcome and follow-up data, and concluding commentary. Such client problems as eating disorders, depression, anxiety, personality disorders, enuresis, dissociative identity disorder, dysmenorrhea, nicotine dependence, attentional deficit disorder, and the aftereffects of sexual abuse and rape are addressed.</p><p></p><h2>Power Distribution Engineering: Fundamentals and Applications (Electrical and Computer Engineering)</h2><p>&#34;Covering virtually all areas of distribution engineering, this complete reference work examines the unique behavior of utilities and provides the practical knowledge necessary to solve real-world distribution problems. &#34;</p><p>.&#34; . .a good overview of common practice in American public distribution systems. . .. . . .gives us a lot of insight in practical problems (and solutions) in power systems.

Posner tracks these two trends to their inevitable intersection: a proliferation of modern academics commenting on topics outside their ken. The resulting scene--one of off-the-cuff pronouncements, erroneous predictions, and ignorant policy proposals--compares poorly with the performance of earlier public intellectuals, largely nonacademics whose erudition and breadth of knowledge were well suited to public discourse. </p><p> Leveling a balanced attack on liberal and conservative pundits alike, Posner describes the styles and genres, constraints and incentives, of the activity of public intellectuals. He identifies a market for this activity--one with recognizable patterns and conventions but an absence of quality controls. And he offers modest proposals for improving the performance of this market--and the quality of public discussion in America today. </p></p><p><b>Richard A.

At the turn of the last century, when farming first began to face the most rapid and extensive series of changes that industrialization would bring, the most compelling and humane voice representing the agrarian tradition came from the botanist, farmer, philosopher, and public intellectual Liberty Hyde Bailey. In 1915, Bailey&#x2019;s environmental manifesto, <i>The Holy Earth</i>, addressed the industrialization of society by utilizing the full range of human vocabulary to assert that the earth&#x2019;s processes and products, because they form the governing conditions of human life, should therefore be understood not first as economic, but as divine. To grasp the extent of human responsibility for the earth, Bailey called for a new hold&#x201d; that society must take to develop a morals of land management,&#x201d; which would later inspire Aldo Leopold&#x2019;s land ethic&#x201d; and several generations of agrarian voices. This message of responsible land stewardship has never been as timely as now.<br><br></p><p>Born on a humble frontier farm in southwest Michigan, <b>Liberty Hyde Bailey</b> (1858-1954) went on to become the Father of Modern Horticulture,&#x201d; a leading public intellectual on the question of rural communities, and a national spokesperson for agricultural policy.

No other writing system of antiquity enjoys this benefit. Since the emergence of the earliest discernible process of writing, in northern China around 1200 b.c., the Chinese system has been used by millions of speakers, and today more people speak a Chinese language than any other. In his accessible, straightforward book, Oliver Moore demystifies one of the world's oldest writing systems, introducing the basic principles of the language, the formation of written characters, and the ways these characters have developed. Drawing on evidence from numerous artifacts in the British Museum and elsewhere, he describes, chronologically, several of the major scripts used to write on each material, from the earliest oracle bones to calligraphic works of art.<br><br>Moore defines the Chinese language both as a member of an East Asian language family and as a broad term covering quite distinct variations in speech within the borders of modern China. He discusses how the Chinese writing system works today, demonstrating how it exerts its influence far beyond the traditional borders of China. The last chapter illustrates instances of Chinese characters borrowed to write non-Chinese languages.</p><p><b>Oliver Moore </b>was formerly a curator in the Department of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, where he specialized in Chinese writing, metalwork, and stone.

Its goal is not to explain how to design a specific city precinct or public space, but to describe useful steps to approach the transformation of urban spaces. Urban Ecological Design illustrates the different stages in which the process is organized, using theories, techniques, images, and case studies. In essence, it presents a "how-to" method to transform the urban landscape that is thoroughly informed by theory and practice.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The authors note that urban design is viewed as an interface between different disciplines. They describe the field as "peacefully overrun, invaded, and occupied" by city planners, architects, engineers, and landscape architects (with developers and politicians frequently joining in). They suggest that environmental concerns demand the consideration of ecology and sustainability issues in urban design. It is, after all, the urban designer who helps to orchestrate human relationships with other living organisms in the built environment. <br>&nbsp; <br>The overall objective of the book is to reinforce the role of the urban designer as an honest broker and promoter of design processes and as an active agent of social creativity in the production of the public realm. <br></p><p>Danilo Palazzo is Associate Professor of Urban Planning and Design at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

An alternate to traditional reading programs, the Merrill Reading Program carefully introduces words according to sound and spelling patterns. Lessons begin with a chalkboard presentation highlighting similarities and differences among words, and repeated practice and exposure to these groups gives students the opportunity to apply and develop decoding skills in ways that encourage comprehension, development, and fluency. Words are grouped according to their sound and spelling similarities to provide a framework for building decoding skills and vocabulary. All levels are carefully sequenced so students develop confidence, and each story uses words introduced in earlier units with sights words incorporated a few at a time. Students never feel overwhelmed because information is introduced at an appropriate rate with ample time spent on review and reinforcement. Carefully crafted stories interest students while introducing comprehension skills. A placement test allows teachers to measure oral reading, vocabulary, and comprehension to help determine where a student starts.</p><p></p><h2>Advanced Calculus and Its Applications to the Engineering and Physical Sciences</h2><p>Written in problem-solving format, this book emphasizes the purpose of an advanced calculus course by offering a more thorough presentation of some topics to which engineering and physical science students have already been exposed.

Focusing on the emergence of an Afghan state out of this imperial milieu, he shows how Afghan nation-making was part of a series of global processes, refuting the usual portrayal of Afghans as pawns in the &#x201c;Great Game&#x201d; of European powers and of Afghanistan as a &#x201c;hermit kingdom.&#x201d;</p><p>In the twentieth century, the pace of Afghan interaction with the rest of the world dramatically increased, and many Afghan men and women came to see themselves at the center of ideological struggles that spanned the globe. Through revolution, war, and foreign occupations, Afghanistan became even more enmeshed in the global circulation of modern politics, occupying a pivotal position in the Cold War and the tumultuous decades that followed.</p></p><p>Robert D. Crews is Professor of History at Stanford University.A comprehensive history of the country... [Crews] dispels the clich�s that have attached themselves to our language and imagery of the country... <i>Afghan Modern</i> [is] required reading for generals, policy-makers, NGOs and journalists. (Heidi Kingstone <i>Standpoint</i>)<br><br>A fresh look at the Afghans that discards old legends and stereotypes and characterizes the people as tremendously mobile and cosmopolitan. Crews rejects the view of Afghanistan as &#x2018;hopelessly archaic and insular&#x2019; and finds that it has been long and unfairly defined by foreign occupiers... An impressively thinking-outside-of-the-box approach to reconsidering this pivotal Asian nation and its people. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i>)<br><br>In a remarkable achievement, Crews shows us how Afghanistan has been an integral part of imperial, international, and now global circuits of politics and culture. Clearing away tenacious stereotypes about Afghan society&#x2019;s domination by tribe, clan, and village, he demonstrates why recent military and humanitarian interventions based on such categories have been disastrous and why Afghan nationalism is likely to survive the violent adventurism that has marked the country&#x2019;s modern history. (Faisal Devji, author of <i>Muslim Zion</i> and <i>The Impossible Indian</i>)<br><br>An exceptional book that, for the first time, places Afghan history on the global stage.

These matchless short works, all unpublished during Kafka&#x2019;s lifetime, range from the gleeful dialogue between a cat and a mouse in &#x201c;Little Fable&#x201d; to the absurd humor of &#x201c;Investigations of a Dog,&#x201d; from the elaborate waking nightmare of &#x201c;Building the Great Wall of China&#x201d; to the creeping unease of &#x201c;The Burrow,&#x201d; where a nameless creature&#x2019;s labyrinthine hiding place turns into a trap of fear and paranoia.</p><p><p><strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (1883&#x2013;1924) was one of the most important writers of the twentieth century. His major novels include&nbsp;<em>The Trial</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Castle</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Amerika</em>.</p><p>The poet Michael Hofmann has won numerous prizes for his German translations.</p>&#x201c;This New Directions release of Investigations of a Dog provides an opportunity to reconsider many of Kafka&#x2019;s greatest stories in a new book, with beautiful cover design, and to reexamine how a brilliant mind performed under spiritually backbreaking circumstances.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hofmann&#x2019;s translation is invaluable&#x2015;it achieves what translations are supposedly unable to do: it is at once &#x2018;loyal&#x2019; and &#x2018;beautiful.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Compare this to any previous translation, and you&#x2019;ll see, for a start, that there is no dilly-dallying with style; the prose is swift, direct and without obfuscation, as, one presumes, Kafka intended. He has cut through literary pretension to seek out the heart of Kafka&#x2019;s work&#x2015;the very &#x2018;particles&#x2019; of his writing, as they have been called. His translation shows Kafka as a modern writer whose work was beyond that of anything written at that time.

It was understood in the past that, in morals or in mathematics, our knowledge begins with certain axioms that must hold true of necessity; that the principles drawn from these axioms hold true universally, unaffected by variations in local "cultures"; and that the presence of these axioms makes it possible to have, in the domain of morals, some right answers. Hadley Arkes restates the grounds of that older understanding and unfolds its implications for the most vexing political problems of our day.</p><br><br><p>The author turns first to the classic debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. After establishing the groundwork and properties of moral propositions, he traces their application in such issues as selective conscientious objection, justifications for war, the war in Vietnam, a nation's obligation to intervene abroad, the notion of supererogatory acts, the claims of "privacy," and the problem of abortion.</p></p><p>An Inquiry into the first principles of morals and justice: This book restores to us an understanding that was once settled in the &#39;moral sciences&#39;: that there are propositions, in morals and law, which are not only true but which cannot be otherwise."<i>First Things</i> is, without question, an important essay in moral philosophy. . . .

Her Revelations are recorded in two versions: the short text, or "first edition", written near the time; and the better-known second version, which is both longer and more complex, completed some twenty years later. The short text, offering personal details edited out in her "second edition", but which allow a better sense of Julian as a person, is presented here in translation. It includes also those chapters from the long text that describe Julian's doctrine of the Motherhood of God. The volume also contains an introduction, placing Julian in the larger context of the fourteenth-century English mystical tradition, and an Interpretative Essay.BR&gt; FRANCES BEER is Professor of English at York University, Toronto.</p><p>"I have been reading Lady Julian of Norwich," declares C.S. Lewis in a letter to his former pupil, the Benedictine mystic Bede Griffiths. "A dangerous book, clearly. I'm glad I didn't read it much earlier." Thomas Merton wrote simply, "There can be no doubt that Julian is the greatest of the English mystics."<p></p><p>Few texts have had held such interest or been the object of such enduring devotion as has Julian of Norwich's 14th-century classic <i>A Revelation of Love</i>. This great work--along with <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> and Teresa of Avila's <i>The Interior Castle</i>--form the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul's quest for the divine. This new translation of Julian's mystical writings offers today's reader immediate access to this most powerful spiritual of books written in English. Julian's message of God's intimate and enabling love is revealed as both beguiling and inescapable. The poetry and rhythmic structure of the original Middle English text are respected, yet it is given fresh immediacy since it is now rendered in inclusive language for the first time ever. Moreover Julian's key ideas are easily identified-even by newcomers to her unique system of thought-by means of an original and authoritative linking commentary at the head of each key chapter, as well as continuing support from highly informative footnotes and a detailed glossary of the main terms used.</p>Julian of Norwich&#39;s fourteenth-century classic, A Revelation of Love - along with The Cloud of Unknowing and Teresa of Avila&#39;s The Interior Castle - forms the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul&#39;s quest for the divine.

For over a century, Churchill has been both praised and condemned for his role in launching this highly controversial naval campaign. For some, the Dardanelles offensive was a brilliant concept that might have dramatically shortened the First World War. To many others, however, Churchill was a reckless amateur who drove his unwilling and misinformed colleagues into a venture that was doomed to fail. <br><br><em>Churchill and the Dardanelles</em>, based on exhaustive archival research, provides a detailed and authoritative account of the Gallipoli campaign's origins and execution, stripping away the layers of myth that have long surrounded these dramatic events, and showing that no simple verdict is either possible or fair. Naval historian Christopher M. Bell untangles Churchill's complicated relationship with the dynamic First Sea Lord, Admiral Jacky Fisher, and reveals for the first time the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to Churchill's removal from office as First Lord of the Admiralty - including Fisher's covert campaign to undermine support for the Dardanelles operation, and the leaks by figures in high places that fueled a bitter press campaign to drive Churchill from power.<br><br>Attention is also given to Churchill's reaction to the results of the Dardanelles offensive in the years that followed: as Bell shows, Churchill spent a good deal of time trying to refute his critics and convince the wider public that the campaign had in fact nearly succeeded. These efforts were so successful that they transformed how the Dardanelles offensive was regarded in popular memory and ensured that is legacy did not stand in the way of Churchill becoming Prime Minister in May 1940. Now, with the aid of archival research, Christopher M. Bell presents a fresh account of how this transformation came to pass.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher M.

Barrett, New Blackfriars</p><h2>The Long Voyage: Selected Letters of Malcolm Cowley, 1915-1987</h2><p><p>Critic, poet, editor, chronicler of the "lost generation," and elder statesman of the Republic of Letters, Malcolm Cowley (1898-1989) was an eloquent witness to much of twentieth-century American literary and political life. These letters, the vast majority previously unpublished, provide an indelible self-portrait of Cowley and his time, and make possible a full appreciation of his long and varied career.</p><p>Perhaps no other writer aided the careers of so many poets and novelists. Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Kerouac, Tillie Olsen, and John Cheever are among the many authors Cowley knew and whose work he supported. A poet himself, Cowley enjoyed the company of writers and knew how to encourage, entertain, and when necessary scold them. At the center of his epistolary life were his friendships with Kenneth Burke, Allen Tate, Conrad Aiken, and Edmund Wilson. By turns serious and thoughtful, humorous and gossipy, Cowley's letters to these and other correspondents display his keen literary judgment and ability to navigate the world of publishing.</p><p>The letters also illuminate Cowley's reluctance to speak out against Stalin and the Moscow Trials when he was on staff at <i>The New Republic--</i>and the consequences of his agonized evasions. His radical past would continue to haunt him into the Cold War era, as he became caught up in the notorious "Lowell Affair" and was summoned to testify in the Alger Hiss trials. Hans Bak supplies helpful notes and a preface that assesses Cowley's career, and Robert Cowley contributes a moving foreword about his father.</p></p><p>Hans Bak is Professor of American Literature and American Studies at Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.[A] vast and rich omnium-gatherum of epistolary activity... <b>Cowley</b> [was] one of the most important and influential men of letters (or freelance literary intellectuals, if you prefer) of the twentieth century... [He had] an immensely influential critical and editorial career that spanned seven decades... [Cowley] is nowhere near as famous or well regarded as he deserves to be...<b> Bak</b>&#x2019;s commentary and notes are helpful, to the point, jargon-free, and superbly well-informed, and the letters themselves have been selected and judiciously edited to form an almost biographical narrative. Because the book focuses on letters that illuminate Cowley&#x2019;s involvement with both literature and politics, the private man barely makes an appearance, but that absence is more than made up for by his son <b>Robert Cowley</b>&#x2019;s foreword, a moving act of filial piety and a shrewd assessment of the shape and significance of his father&#x2019;s career. And why should anyone produce an 850-page volume of Malcolm Cowley&#x2019;s letters, and why should you care that someone did? Because, simply put, the American literature of the twentieth century would look considerably poorer and less interesting without his activities as a critic, editor, and memoirist, and our broader understanding of American literary history much less clear... If you don&#x2019;t reckon with Malcolm Cowley&#x2019;s works and days, you can't really understand how American literature ascended to its rightful place among the great literatures of the world, or how it was made. (Gerald Howard <i>Bookforum</i> 2013-12-01)<br><br>A committed, contentious life at the center of American letters comes alive in this scintillating collection. The book follows <b>Cowley</b> (1898-1989) from his 1920s salad days as a poet and critic in New York and Paris, immersed in fierce literary squabbles over the emerging modernist aesthetic; through his 1930s reign as the <i>New Republic</i>'s literary editor, when he discovered Marxism and drew (not unfounded) accusations of pushing a Stalinist line that dogged him during and after World War II; to his postwar efforts to champion old masters and newcomers, from Fitzgerald and Faulkner to Kerouac and Kesey. Cowley's letters fizz with gossip, bawdy jokes, lurid anecdotes, witty reflections... Ably contextualized by editor <b>Bak</b>'s extensive biographical insertions, these missives convey the intense passions aroused by the aesthetic and political upheavals of the 20th century through the pen of one of the era's leading literary intellectuals.

(Paul Hendrickson, author of <i>Hemingway&#x2019;s Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934&#x2013;1961</i>)<br><br>Boswell of the &#x2018;lost generation,&#x2019; literary editor of <i>The New Republic</i>, and champion of authors from Fitzgerald and Faulkner--whose career he resuscitated--to Kerouac and Kesey, <b>Malcolm Cowley</b> lived a long life and wrote a ton of letters debating, critiquing and defending the state of American literature. (Kenneth Burke, Allen Tate, Conrad Aiken and Edmund Wilson were among his closest interlocutors.) The majority of the letters in this collection have never before been published...His collected letters amount to a heady portrait of American literary and intellectual life in the twentieth century. (Rachel Arons <i>New Yorker blog</i> 2013-12-01)<br><br>Hans Bak&#x2019;s selection of <b>Cowley</b>&#x2019;s letters will interest anyone with specialized knowledge of American literature during its 20th-century apogee...<i>The Long Voyage</i> [is] a fine memorial of those high days when book reviewers were not afraid of showing their intelligence and discrimination, and wrote pieces that changed the way the educated segment of nations thought. (Richard Davenport-Hines <i>The Spectator</i> 2014-01-11)<br><br><b>Cowley</b> was perhaps the greatest literary cross-pollinator of the 20th century. It&#x2019;s impossible to imagine the American canon without him...Cowley&#x2019;s best letters--they are alternately frisky, warm, pushy and ruminative--are collected now in <i>The Long Voyage</i>...Many are to his childhood friend from Pittsburgh, the philosopher of language Kenneth Burke, and to his lifelong confidant Allen Tate. This volume also records his end of correspondences with Faulkner, Kerouac, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Dawn Powell, Lionel Trilling, Louise Bogan, Edmund Wilson and multiple others...Consistently busy on a multitude of fronts, Cowley wrote letters that are grainy with gossip and ringing observations, almost from the beginning. (Dwight Garner <i>New York Times</i> 2014-02-11)<br><br>As a poet, editor, literary historian and memoirist, <b>Cowley</b> (1898-1989) had his finger on the pulse of American literature for most of the 20th century...In this collection, editor Bak gathers approximately 500 letters culled from Cowley&#x2019;s papers in Chicago&#x2019;s Newberry Library, most previously unpublished. Correspondents include Kenneth Burke (a childhood friend), Allen Tate, Conrad Aiken, Edmund Wilson, Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Tillie Olsen, and almost anyone who was anybody in American literature...In addition to his literary activities, the letters shed light on Cowley&#x2019;s politics, including his ties to communist front organizations in the 1930s, his reaction to the Moscow Trials, and his fight to preserve his reputation during the McCarthy era...This title will appeal to students of modern American literature, particularly those familiar with Cowley&#x2019;s oeuvre. (William Gargan <i>Library Journal</i> 2014-01-15)<br><br><b>Malcolm Cowley</b> was one of the most important (and easily the most omnipresent) literary figures of the past century...Cowley&#x2019;s was a long, eventful and controversial life, amply documented in his letters...<b>Bak</b> has done on the whole an astounding job of effectively boiling down Cowley&#x2019;s voluminous correspondence...To delve into Cowley&#x2019;s letters is to get a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse at how the literary life, with its glittering prizes, really operates...This volume is a permanent addition to American literary history the likes of which we may never see again. If the telephone made letter-writing a luxury, email and texting have rendered it as obsolete as the manual typewriter, and we as readers are undoubtedly the poorer for it. That is all the more reason to cherish this invaluable collection. (Tom Moran <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2014-02-21)<br><br><b>Cowley</b> earned, many times over, his status as the grand old man of American letters. Did anyone do more to establish the current canon of the major writers of the twentieth century? Did anyone do more than Cowley, as the indefatigable consulting editor for Viking, to identify new talent among the following generations?<b> </b>...Did anyone work harder behind the scenes of influential organizations (the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Yaddo, countless book prizes, and so on) to support writers in need and &nbsp;reward deserving achievement? ...He ultimately belonged, like Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Faulkner, to what his friend Hart Crane called &#x2018;the visionary company,&#x2019; and not as a fellow traveler but as a full member. (Christopher Benfey <i>New Republic</i> 2014-03-03)</p><h2>Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the American Presidency</h2><p>Today when we think of covert operations, we think of American-backed mercenaries circulating through jungle camps of Contra guerrillas, CIA agents plotting coups against governments in Chile and Libya, or the lethal cigars used in an attempt to assassinate Castro. In the public imagination, these kinds of operations--often seeming to go over the line, and always hidden from Congress and the American people--are a recent innovation, a rogue offspring of the Cold War, and perhaps even a violation of the democratic ideals on which this country was founded. But in this fascinating volume, Stephen F. Knott demonstrates that such covert operations have a long history in the United States, dating back to the Founding Fathers themselves.<br> In <em>Secret and Sanctioned</em>, Knott reveals that presidents have relied upon clandestine activities since the American Revolution. Indeed, many of the figures closely associated with American liberty were most active in carrying out covert operations. George Washington, for instance, was not only his own spymaster during the war of independence--corresponding with agents through letters written with invisible ink, creating fake businesses as cover for his spies, and misleading the British by planting false information--but he even went so far as to plan to kidnap King George III's son. Likewise, Thomas Jefferson once considered burning down Saint Paul's Cathedral in London and, as president, wielded clandestine agents freely, whether against North American Indians or North African Barbary states. (At one point, Jefferson plotted to overthrow the Pasha of Tripoli by backing the man's estranged brother, then abandoned the brother when the Pasha sued for peace.) Knott goes on to survey the continuing tradition of clandestine activities in later administrations, from Polk to Lincoln and beyond. Their operations have a familiar ring, from covert support for disaffected elements in Mexico in 1846, to planting stories in newspapers to demoralize the South and influence foreign opinion during the Civil War, to the coordination of a coup in Hawaii to ensure annexation of the islands. And far from taking Congress or the people into his confidence, the chief executive has always jealously guarded his covert weapons from the prying eyes of Senators and Representatives, seeing such activities as a necessary tool of statecraft and a constitutional expression of executive power.<br> In the years following the Watergate scandal, Congress launched a series of investigations into covert operations that led many Americans to conclude that we had wandered far from the example of our Founding Fathers. In <em>Secret and Sanctioned</em>, Knott sets the record straight, showing that the clandestine activities of the postwar era did not mark a break in the American political tradition, nor a departure from our political principles, but followed in a direct line from the understanding of executive power held by Washington and Jefferson and many other American presidents.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen F. Knott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the United States Air Force Academy.<br>Repercussions from abuses of power by back-to-back Democratic and Republican presidents (Johnson and Nixon) still echo through American life. If congressional assertion of control in response to the presidential misuse of the CIA was perhaps too extreme, then this volume attempts to present the other side. Basing this work on his doctoral dissertation at Boston College, the author, now an assistant professor of political science at the U.S. Air Force Academy, presents a brief chronological treatment of covert operations by American presidents from George Washington through George Bush. International law and morality are dismissed as constraints as Knott tries to refute Frank Church's Senate Report on Intelligence Activities (1976). Historians will find little new here, and critics will remain unconvinced, but it is a readable effort that raises the issue of the proper role of the CIA and covert operations in the foreign policy of a republic.

RDF provides a consistent framework and syntax for describing and querying data, making it possible to share website descriptions more easily. RDF's capabilities, however, have long been shrouded by its reputation for complexity and a difficult family of specifications. <i>Practical RDF</i> breaks through this reputation with immediate and solvable problems to help you understand, master, and implement RDF solutions.<i>Practical RDF</i> explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects.The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML.If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, <i>Practical RDF</i> is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF.</p></p><p><p>Shelley Powers is an independent contractor, currently living in St. Louis, who specializes in technology architecture and software development.

How this view of the world came to be, and how we lost it (or turned away from it) on the way to becoming modern, make for a fascinating story, told in a highly accessible manner by R�mi Brague in this wide-ranging cultural history.<br><br>Before the Greeks, people thought human action was required to maintain the order of the universe and so conducted rituals and sacrifices to renew and restore it. But beginning with the Hellenic Age, the universe came to be seen as existing quite apart from human action and possessing, therefore, a kind of wisdom that humanity did not. Wearing his remarkable erudition lightly, Brague traces the many ways this universal wisdom has been interpreted over the centuries, from the time of ancient Egypt to the modern era. Socratic and Muslim philosophers, Christian theologians and Jewish Kabbalists all believed that questions about the workings of the world and the meaning of life were closely intertwined and that an understanding of cosmology was crucial to making sense of human ethics. Exploring the fate of this concept in the modern day, Brague shows how modernity stripped the universe of its sacred and philosophical wisdom, transforming it into an ethically indifferent entity that no longer serves as a model for human morality.<br><br>Encyclopedic and yet intimate,<i> The Wisdom of the World</i> offers the best sort of history: broad, learned, and completely compelling. Brague opens a window onto systems of thought radically different from our own.</p><p><b>R�mi Brague</b> is a professor of philosophy at the Universit� de Paris I-Sorbonne and at the University of Munich.

Grounded in solid research and three decades of entrepreneurial experience, this book has one purpose: to teach you how to be both the boss everyone wants to work for and the high achiever every CEO wants to hire&#x2014;all without drama, stress, or endless hours in the office<br> <br> Inspired by Kruse's viral article "Why Successful Leaders Don't Have an Open Door Policy," this contrarian approach to leadership reveals why you should throw out the rulebook and instead play favorites, crowd your calendar, tell employees everything (even salaries), stay out of meetings, hide your phone, and more. Kruse makes the case for these principles with engaging real-world stories and case studies, and shows how to use this wisdom to buck the trend and become more effective. He also shares applications beyond the office&#x2014;at home, in sales, in sports, and more. Ultimately, his advice empowers you to focus on what matters, which is the key to success for you, your employees, and your company.<br></p><p><b>Kevin Kruse </b>is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and founder+CEO of the AI tech company LEADx.

He reveals the extent to which Greek, Persian, and Jewish historians influenced the Western historiographic tradition, and then goes on to examine the first Roman historians and the emergence of national history. In the course of his exposition, he traces the development of antiquarian studies as distinctive branch of historical research from antiquity to the modern period, discusses the place of Tacitus in historical thought, and explores the way in which ecclesiastical historiography has developed a tradition of its own. All these lectures illustrate Momigliano's unrivaled ability to combine the study of classical texts and the history of classical scholarship.&nbsp;First delivered in 1962, the lectures were revised during the next fifteen years and then held for annotation that was never completed. They are now published from the author's manuscripts, collated and checked by Momigliano's literary executor, Anne Marie Meyer, of the Warburg Institute, with a foreword by Riccardo Di Donato, of the University of Pisa. The text is printed as the author left it.&nbsp;Sather Classical Lectures, 54</p><p>"The book is marvelously erudite, using the historiography of the ancient world to set off on am arch through the ages. What Momigliano brings to the subject that no one else can is a keen scent for the Nachleben of classical authors. His intimate knowledge of Renaissance scholarship and his familiarity with modern intellectual history give this text dimensions that no comparable work possesses."--Erich S. Gruen, University of California, Berkeley&nbsp;"These lectures are vintage Momigliano, full of deep learning, new associations, sound judgments, mastery of a broad range of literature from several different cultures, and all bearing the inimitable stamp of one of this century's leading intellectual historians. Here is a fascinating, original exploration of how the aims and methods of historians in Isreal, Greece, and Rome helped shape the development of Western historiography."--Ronald S. Stroud, University of California, BerkeleyArnaldo Momigliano (1908-87) was born and educated in Italy. He was appointed to the chair of Roman history at the University of Turin in 1936, but deprived of his professorship under Mussolini&#39;s racial decree, he settled in Oxford in 1939.

Each book in the series contains hundreds of developmentally age-appropriate activities to build young children&#39;s competence and confidence in specific skills in a positive, enjoyable learning environment. The primary focus is to provide quality teaching, assessment, and remediation to meet the specific needs of each individual child.</p><p>Joanne M.

KeithIntroduction to Complete Motor Skills Activities Program The Complete Motor Skills Activities Program consists of three books: Ready-to-Use Fundamental Motor Skills &amp; Movement Activities for Young Children Ready-to-Use Fine Motor Skills &amp; Handwriting Activities for Young Children Ready-to-Use Motor Skills &amp; Movement Station Lesson Plans for Young Children <p>This program has been designed as a motor skills program for teachers, professionals, and parents in related fields (remedial, rehabilitation, and medical areas), working in the school environment, the home environment, or the community environment to assist children who have coordination difficulties in the performance and mastering of fundamental movement skills. </p><p>The focus of this program is to provide enjoyable developmentally-appropriate movement experiences in the teaching of these fundamental movement skills so that the children gain both competence and confidence in successfully performing these skills. </p><p>We emphasize that if the strategies are to be successful, teachers and parents need to be aware that although children may be able to perform the tasks adequately in terms of task completion, focus must be directed to how the task is completed; that is, focus must be directed toward quality of the movement-not just the outcome of the movement. </p><p>FINE MOTOR SKILLS &amp; HANDWRITING </p><p>This book has been produced to provide educators, parents and other professionals working with children, an overview of the key elements of fine motor control and handwriting. It was never meant to be a resource for extracting reproducible material, but a guide to developmental aspects of these areas and examples of practical activities that will be useful in determining when and what should be included in teaching and remediation programs. </p><p>Manipulative Activities </p><p>Most manipulative activities require the use of the two hands working together to perform the task These are referred to as bi-manual activities. Single handed manipulative activities are referred to as uni-manual activities, for example, opening a door. The third type of manipulative activities are graphic activities which include drawing and handwriting. </p><p>In general, children show the most improvement in simple fine motor control behaviors from 4 to 6 years, whereas more complex control behaviors tend to improve gradually from 5 to 12 years. Isolated finger, hand, wrist and foot movements tend to improve significantly from 5 to 8 years. </p><p>Word processing has created an alternative method of graphic communication to handwriting, however in schools and especially in the early years, handwriting still remains the main method by which children communicate their thoughts and ideas. Historically, teachers have been encouraged to teach handwriting models and children have adapted as best they can to the model. Realistically, we should be attempting to adapt the model to fit the child's needs and physical abilities. </p><p>The method of teaching handwriting is, therefore, far more important than the model itself and teaching handwriting should reflect this. The old saying "you can please all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time" is no truer than when teaching children handwriting. Handwriting is as individual as the child. All the elements of a particular model are not going to suit all children. Variations exist in adult handwriting; why not with children's handwriting? After all, a letter is just a visible trace of a hand movement and we all move in different ways, especially in the quality of our movements. </p><p>Motor memory is also an important component to this learning process and relates to the child's ability to visually and auditorially copy single movements, movement patterns, and rhythm patterns. </p><p>Current research suggests that if children do not reach a degree of competence and confidence in fundamental movement skills by the sixth grade, they will not engage in regular physical activity or sports for the rest of their lives. </p><p>Seven Essential Keys </p><p>Successful skills teaching in fundamental movement skills can result if you incorporate the following seven essential keys: </p><p>1. Show enthusiasm, care, and interest. These are qualities that cannot be written into any program. They come from you, and without them the program is not going to be so effective as it could be. </p><p>2. Use visual demonstration with instruction whenever possible. You may even need to physically move the child through some of the actions. </p><p>3. Give praise, encouragement, and feedback. These are an essential part of the learning process. Simply to say "do your best" does not bring about a constructive change. What is needed is good information about techniques and feedback (information about what the child has done). For example, "I watched the way you held the ball correctly in your fingers" or "That was a great effort; this time let's put your other foot forward." </p><p>4. Create a positive, fun learning environment. Sometimes we get preoccupied with telling the child what he or she is doing wrong or what he or she has not done instead of focusing on what he or she should be doing. A positive comment indicates to a child approval; the child can then develop trust and a willingness to keep trying. </p><p>5. Keep the information simple and easy to follow. Teaching by small-step progression is ideal. Progress may be a lot slower than you think and so patience definitely becomes a virtue. </p><p>6. Keep the home play sessions shorter, more frequent, yet allowing for ample practice. Some parents may be too enthusiastic and make the session simply too long. By keeping the sessions shorter, you can ensure that physical and mental fatigue do not become a factor and that the child's interest level is sustained. </p><p>7. Avoid showing frustration; be patient. If you feel frustrated, imagine how the child must feel. Frustration on your part is easily picked up by the child and compounds difficulties. Try saying "I think this is a good place to stop for today. Let's continue tomorrow."</p></p><h2>Educating the Creative Arts Therapist: A Profile of the Profession</h2><p>By Shaun McNiff, Endicott College, Beverly, Massachusetts</p><p></p><h2>A History of the Spanish Language</h2><p>This book provides a clear and elegant account of the development of Spanish over the last 2000 years. Although principally oriented towards &#39;internal&#39; history, &#39;external&#39; history is considered in outline in the Introduction and is referred to throughout. The four principal chapters deal in detail with phonological development, and with morpho-syntactical, lexical and semantic change. Professor Penny&#39;s treatment of the sound-system is in terms both of broad patterns of change and specific phonemic developments, and is described in two main phases: spoken Latin to medieval Spanish, and medieval to modern Spanish. In the chapter on morpho-syntax, grammatical morphology and lexical morphology are treated separately, with particular attention paid to word formation. The sources of Spanish vocabulary, inherited and borrowed, are discussed in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 is concerned with causes, typology and effects of semantic change. Written as a textbook, the comprehensive coverage of the major varieties of Spanish given here will be welcomed by scholars and students alike.</p><p>This textbook provides a clear and elegant account of the development of Spanish over the last 2000 years.Ralph Penny is Professor of Romance Philology at Queen Mary, University of London.

Lang considered it his most lasting work. Peter Lorre&#39;s extraordinary performance as the childlike misfit Hans Beckert was one of the most striking of film debuts, and it made him an international star. Lang&#39;s vision of a city gripped with fear, haunted by surveillance and total mobillization, is still remarkably powerful today. And &#39;M&#39; resonates too in the serial-killer genre which is so prominent in contemporary cinema. &#39;M&#39; speaks to us as a timeless classic, but also as a Weimar film that has too often been isolated from its political and cultural context. In this groundbreaking book, Anton Kaes reconnects &#39;M&#39;&#39;s much-studied formal brilliance to its significance as an event in 1931 Germany, recapturing the film&#39;s extraordinary social and symbolic energy. Interweaving close reading with cultural history, Kaes reconstitutes &#39;M&#39; as a crucial modernist artwork. In addition he analyzes Joseph Losey&#39;s 1951 film noir remake and, in an appendix, publishes for the first time &#39;M&#39;&#39;s missing scene.</p><p><b>Anton Kaes</b> is Chancellor's Professor of German and Film Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, USA.

Delving into the cultural origins of this preoccupation with masculinity, Cuordileone shows how the excessive emphasis placed on masculine virility in political life reflected acute mid-twentieth century anxieties about manhood and sexuality as well the ideological imperatives of the cold war. Reading major public figures like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Adlai Stevenson, J. Edgar Hoover, Joseph McCarthy, Norman Mailer, David Riesman, William Whyte, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy as well as many lesser know experts and cultural commentators, Cuordileone reveals how deep anxieties about a decline in American masculinity shaped the political dynamics of the time and inspired a reinvention of the liberal as a cold warrior in the figure of JFK.</p><p><strong>K.A.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Black students organized hundreds of protests that sparked a period of crackdown, negotiation, and reform that profoundly transformed college life. At stake was the very mission of higher education. Black students demanded that public universities serve their communities; that private universities rethink the mission of elite education; and that black colleges embrace self-determination and resist the threat of integration. Most crucially, black students demanded a role in the definition of scholarly knowledge.<br><br>Martha Biondi masterfully combines impressive research with a wealth of interviews from participants to tell the story of how students turned the slogan &#x201c;black power&#x201d; into a social movement. Vividly demonstrating the critical linkage between the student movement and changes in university culture, Biondi illustrates how victories in establishing Black Studies ultimately produced important intellectual innovations that have had a lasting impact on academic research and university curricula over the past 40 years. This book makes a major contribution to the current debate on Ethnic Studies, access to higher education, and opportunity for all.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Martha Biondi's superb book is a pioneering treatment of the integral role of courageous black students in the turbulent 60s. In our age of the Occupy Movement, we badly need this wonderful work!"<br><br>&#x2015;Cornel West, author of <i>Race Matters</i><br>&#x201c;<i>The Black Revolution on Campus</i> is a passionate and powerful piece of scholarship about a dramatic moment in the evolution of American universities: the period in the 1960s and 1970s when the Black Power Movement clashed with the liberal sensibilities of Western cultural empire building. Biondi carefully demonstrates why this era of intellectual insurgency, led by Black students and their white allies, was significant. It allowed those whose stories had been left out of the curriculum to begin to speak truth to power. But it also made space for other movements (such as feminism and gay rights) to become important parts of the contemporary academic curriculum. Biondi invites the reader to do more than bear witness to an important scholarly debate about the role of black studies on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s. Her probing analysis illuminates enduring yet evolving truths about our larger culture and its myths of American life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2015;Lani Guinier, Bennett Boskey Professor of Law, Harvard Law School<br>&#x201c;The Black Revolution on Campus is the first comprehensive account detailing the struggles for black studies within institutions of higher education in the United States.

Each level covers about 100 hours of class work. The &#34;Collins COBUILD English Course&#34; has a new language syllabus - a lexical syllabus. Unlike traditional syllabuses, this lexical syllabus starts from a description of real language. COBUILD research has established that the 700 most frequent words of English account for 70% of all English text. The most frequent 1500 words make up 76% of text and a total of 2500 words constitute 80% of all spoken and written English. In taking these 2500 words, and their meanings as core items, this syllabus offers genuine coverage of the most central and typical patterns of English. The task based methodology provides a motivating context in which the learner is encouraged to communicate in English. Early oral and written tasks are very simple, so learners can readily achieve task objectives in English. Each level of the course comprises the following components: (1) Student&#39;s Book - in full colour throughout. Sections are numbered sequentially through the book, facilitating cross-referencing between the sections and the Practice Book.

He describes as no other author has done the multifarious duties of the cooper, the whalecraftsman, the rigger, the subtleties of boat gear and of stowage, the homely whims and prejudices of the most conservative and practical of men ... he has returned unsoured from his voyaging, and now lays his booty before us." &#x2014; Robert Cushman Murphy, in the Introduction <br>Since the days of <i>Moby Dick</i>, whaling has been the subject of countless books, articles and works of art. Few books on the subject, however, have attained the classic stature of the present volume. Written by a famed marine artist, born in the whaling center of New Bedford, Massachusetts, this book presents whaling from the vantage point of one who not only sailed aboard a whaler himself, but possessed the observant eye of an artist and the literary skill to record what he saw and thought as the great age of whaling drew to a close.<br>Salted with wit and wisdom of a Yankee seaman, Ashley's engrossing account presents the "bloody and desperate quest" for the great whales and their valuable meat and oil. It offers detailed, evocative pictures of whaling traditions, life aboard ship, the myriad details of whaleship construction, rigging and navigation, gear and craft; much whalemen's lore concerning methods of attack and the behavior of the quarry, as well as sidelights on the unique personalities of whalemen from New Bedford, Nantucket, and Long Island ports.<br>Enhanced with 150 superb illustrations, <i>The Yankee Whaler</i> is perhaps the definitive treatment of 19th- century whaling. Not only a complete and well-documented picture of every aspect of the topic, the book at the same time evokes the excitement and drama of the chase and the romance of the high seas.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches</h2><p>First Published in 2004.

By temperament, he was a high-strung and sensitive romantic, a towering figure whose tempestuous personal life found powerfully coherent expression in the ever-shifting textures of his music. Now, acclaimed music critic Gene Santoro strips away the myths shrouding "Jazz's Angry Man," revealing Mingus as more complex than even his close friends knew. Written in a lively, novelistic style, <em>Myself When I Am Real</em> draws on dozens of new interviews and previously untapped letters and archival materials to explore the intricate connections between this extraordinary man and the extraordinary music he made.<br></p><p>In an art form known for its outrageous characters, Charles Mingus stood out. To paraphrase Walt Whitman, he was a man of "multitudes." He was a forceful, virtuosic bassist. He was an imaginative and original composer and arranger second only to Duke Ellington. He was also a social critic, bully, lady's man, father, and hypersensitive man-child who simply wanted to be appreciated for his work. Making sense of this larger-than-life personality presents an imposing challenge to any biographer. Enter Gene Santoro. The author of <i>Dancing in Your Head</i> and <i>Stir It Up: Musical Mixes from Roots to Jazz</i>, Santoro updates Brian Priestley's <i>Mingus: A Critical Biography</i>; separates the fact from the fiction of Mingus's rowdy autobiography, <i>Beneath the Underdog</i>; and produces the literary equivalent of a masterful Mingus composition, complete with labyrinthine surprises and complexities. <p> A light-skinned African American with Native American and Asian bloodlines who was born in 1922, Mingus endured a difficult childhood in Los Angeles, forever stung by the rampant racism that halted his dreams of a career in the classical music field. Undaunted, Mingus went on to work with several jazz giants, including Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, and Duke Ellington, before creating his own record company (Debut) and composing over 300 iconoclastic compositions, including "Eclipse," "Haitian Fight Song," "Goodbye Porkpie Hat," "Cumbia and Jazz Fusion," and many other jazz standards. Santoro writes that the music "is overwhelming in its torrent of musical styles and psychological switchbacks and emotional punch, its tumble of raucous gospel swing, luminous melodies, European classical threads, bebop tributes, Mexican and Colombian and Indian music and sounds from anywhere and everywhere." </p><p> In addition to his keen insights into the music (including a thorough discography), Santoro deftly analyzes Mingus's mercurial personality. From the highs (his celebrated recordings <i>Blues &amp; Roots</i> and <i>Mingus Ah Um</i>) to the lows (his horrible <i>Epitaph</i> concert, his eviction from his New York apartment, his numerous assaults on sidemen, and his slow death from Lou Gehrig's disease in 1979), Santoro fairly and faithfully lays bare the mind, body, soul, and art of an American original who influenced everyone from Wynton Marsalis to Joni Mitchell. "Mingus' music was autobiography in sound," Santoro writes. "Everyone in his life had a role. His portraits, his musical tributes, his insistence on forcing his sidemen to find themselves in what he imagined, his clamor for recognition, his emphasis on his originality ... these were more than stylistic trademarks. They were the essence of who he was." <i>Myself When I Am Real</i> captures this essence brilliantly. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>"The best examination yet of an American Original" -The Washington Post <p>"The great bassist and composer's wild, turbulent life [is] wonderfully captured by Santoro." -Rolling Stone </p><p>"Santoro's unconventional but meticulously researched biography is deliciously entertaining examination not only of jazz's 'angry man' and his music, but of the times in which both flourished. Santoro casts Mingus as a central character in the restless drama of a postwar America wrestling to find its identity politically, socially, and artistically." -The Boston Globe </p><p>"Santoro brings his readers into the mind of this conflicted genius." -Philadelphia Inquirer </p><p>"Santoro's ambitious and engrossing biography has the vivd force of a bravura performance by one of its subject's classic Jazz Workship ensembles." -The San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"The definitive Mingus biography." -The Boston Book Review </p><p>"Written with the elegant hand of an experienced journalist and the insight of a musician with first-rate ears, the book accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of casting a revealing light upon the inner life of its enigmatic subject." -Los Angeles Times</p></p><h2>Software Optimization for High-Performance Computers</h2><p>This is the most hands-on guide to writing high-performance software. Using many practical examples, two of Hewlett-Packard's leading software performance experts review both code-based and algorithm-based techniques. This book addresses every key factor that impacts software performance, from mathematical libraries to compilers to underlying hardware.<p>The authors review the role of processor design in software performance, covering each leading approach, and offering comparative optimization strategies for CISC, RISC, vector and Long Instruction Word computing, and the new Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) design used by Intel/HP IA-64 processors. They address storage devices, including cache and system memory; and review each leading approach to parallel processing, including distributed memory and shared memory (UMA and NUMA) designs. The book includes detailed chapters on compiler optimization; profiling and timing code; algorithmic approaches to parallelism such as compiler directives, threads, and message passing. It also demonstrates powerful techniques for enhancing performance through the use of mathematical libraries, mathematical kernels, and equation-solving techniques such as LU decomposition.</p></p><p>Preface Once you start asking questions, innocence is gone.<br> - Mary Astor <p> This purpose of this book is to document many of the techniques used by people who implement applications on modern computers and want their programs to execute as quickly as possible. </p><p> There are four major components that determine the speed of an application: the architecture, the compiler, the source code, and the algorithm. You usually don't have control over the architecture you use, but you need to understand it so you'll know what it is capable of achieving. You do have control over your source code and how compilers are used on it. This book discusses how to perform source code modifications and use the compiler to generate better performing applications. The final and arguably the most important part is the algorithms used. By replacing the algorithms you have or were given with better performing ones, or even tweaking the existing ones, you can reap huge performance gains and perform problems that had previously been unachievable. </p><p> There are many reasons to want applications to execute quickly. Sometimes it is the only way to make sure that a program finishes execution in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the decision to bid or no-bid an oil lease is often determined by whether a seismic image can be completed before the bid deadline. A new automotive body design may or may not appear in next year's model depending on whether the structural and aerodynamic analysis can be completed in time. Since developers of applications would like an advantage over their competitors, speed can sometimes be the differentiator between two similar products. Thus, writing programs to run quickly can be a good investment. </p><p> P.1 A Tool Box<br> We like to think of this book as a tool box. The individual tools are the various optimization techniques discussed. As expected, some tools are more useful than others. Reducing the memory requirements of an application is a general tool that frequently results in better single processor performance. Other tools, such as the techniques used to optimize a code for parallel execution, have a more limited scope. </p><p> These tools are designed to help applications perform well on computer system components. You can apply them to existing code to improve performance or use them to design efficient code from scratch. As you become proficient with the tools, some general trends become apparent. All applications have a theoretical performance limit on any computer. The first attempts at optimization may involve choosing between basic compiler options. This doesn't take much time and can help performance considerably. The next steps may involve more complicated compiler options, modifying a few lines of source code, or reformulating an algorithm. The theoretical peak performance is like the speed of light. As more and more energy, or time, is expended, the theoretical peak is approached, but never quite achieved. Before optimizing applications, it is prudent to consider how much time you can, or should, commit to optimization. </p><p> In the past, one of the problems with tuning code was that even with a large investment of a time the optimizations quickly became outdated. For example, there were many applications that had been optimized for vector computers which subsequently had to be completely reoptimized for massively parallel computers. This sometimes took many person-years of effort. Since massively parallel computers never became plentiful, much of this effort had very short-term benefit. </p><p> In the 1990s, many computer companies either went bankrupt or were purchased by other companies as the cost of designing and manufacturing computers skyrocketed. As a result, there are very few computer vendors left today and most of today's processors have similar characteristics. For example, they nearly all have high-speed caches. Thus, making sure that code is structured to run well on cache-based systems ensures that the code runs well across almost all modern platforms. </p><p> The examples in this book are biased in favor of the UNIX operating system and RISC processors. This is because they are most characteristic of modern high performance computing. The recent EPIC (IA64) processors have cache structures identical to those of RISC processors, so the examples also apply to them. </p><p> P.2 Language Issues<br> This book uses lots of examples. They are written in Fortran, C, or in a language-independent pseudocode. Fortran examples use uppercase letters while the others use lowercase. For example, </p><p> </p><p></p><p>DO I = 1,N</p><p>Y(I) = Y(I) + A * X(I)</p><p>ENDDO </p><p> </p><p> takes a scalar A, multiplies it by a vector x of length N and adds it to a vector Y of length N. Languages such as Fortran 90/95 and C++ are very powerful and allow vector or matrix notation. For example, if x and Y are two-dimensional arrays and A is a scalar, writing </p><p></p><p>Y = Y + A * X </p><p> </p><p> means to multiple the array x by A and add the result to the matrix Y This notation has been avoided since it can obscure the analysis performed. The notation may also make it more difficult to compilers to optimize the source code. </p><p> There is an entire chapter devoted to language specifics, but pseudo-code and Fortran examples assume that multidimensional arrays such as Y (200, 100) have the data stored in memory in column-major order. Thus the elements of Y (200, 100) are stored as </p><p></p><p>Y(1,1), Y(2,1), Y(3,1),..., Y(200,1), Y(1,2), Y(1,3),... </p><p> This is the opposite of C data storage where data is stored in row-major order. </p><p> P.3 Notation<br> When terms are defined, we'll use italics to set the term apart from other text. Courier font will be used for all examples. Mathematical terms and equations use italic font. We'll use lots of prefixes for the magnitude of measurements, so the standard ones are defined in the following table.</p><p>Table P-1: Standard Prefixes</p><p>Prefix Factor Factor</p><p>tera 1012 240</p><p>giga 109 230</p><p>mega 106 220</p><p>kilo 103 210</p><p>milli 10-3</p><p>micro 10-6</p><p>nano 10-9</p><p></p><p> Note that some prefixes are defined using both powers of 10 and powers of two. The exact arithmetic values are somewhat different. Observe that 106 = 1,000,000 while 210 = 1,048,576. This can be confusing, but when quantifying memory, cache, or data in general, associate the prefixes with powers of two. Otherwise, use the more common powers of 10. </p><p> Finally, optimizing applications should be fun. It's really a contest between you and the computer. Computers sometimes give up performance grudgingly, so understand what the computer is realistically capable of and see that you get it. Enjoy the challenge!</p><p> <b>The hands-on guide to high-performance coding and algorithm optimization.</b> </p> <p> This hands-on guide to software optimization introduces state-of-the-art solutions for every key aspect of software performance &#x2013; both code-based and algorithm-based. </p> <p> Two leading HP software performance experts offer comparative optimization strategies for RISC and for the new Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) design used in Intel IA-64 processors.

In this comedy of manners, the heroine learns to come to terms with the reality of other people, and with her own erring nature.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus.

Author Douglas Streusand explains the origins of the three empires; compares the ideological, institutional, military, and economic contributors to their success; and analyzes the causes of their rise, expansion, and ultimate transformation and decline. Streusand depicts the three empires as a part of an integrated international system extending from the Atlantic to the Straits of Malacca, emphasizing both the connections and the conflicts within that system. He presents the empires as complex polities in which Islam is one political and cultural component among many. The treatment of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires incorporates contemporary scholarship, dispels common misconceptions, and provides an excellent platform for further study.</p><p>Douglas E StreusandDouglas Streusand has brilliantly complemented, filled out, and updated Marshall Hodgson's pioneering study of the Islamic gunpowder empires of the early modern era.

Orlando Figes and Boris Kolonitskii examine the diverse ways that language and other symbols&#x2015;including flags and emblems, public rituals, songs, and codes of dress&#x2015;were used to identify competing sides and to create new meanings in the political struggles of 1917. The revolution was in many ways a battle to control these systems of symbolic meaning, the authors find. The party or faction that could master the complexities of the lexicon of the revolution was well on its way to mastering the revolution itself.<br><br>The book explores how key words and symbols took on different meanings in various social and political contexts. &#x201c;Democracy,&#x201d; &#x201c;the people,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the working class,&#x201d; for example, could define a wide range of identities and moral worlds in 1917. In addition to such ambiguities, cultural tensions further complicated the revolutionary struggles. Figes and Kolonitskii consider the fundamental clash between the Western political discourse of the socialist parties and the traditional political culture of the Russian masses. They show how the particular conditions and perceptions that colored Russian politics in 1917 led to the emergence of the cult of the revolutionary leader and the culture of terror. </p></p><p>Orlando Figes is the author of eight books on Russia that have been translated into twenty-seven languages; they include "The Whisperers", "A People s Tragedy", "Natasha s Dance", and "Just Send Me Word". A professor of history at Birkbeck, University of London and a frequent contributor to "The New York Review of Books", Figes is the recipient of the Wolfon History Prize, the W. H. Smith Literary Award, the NCR Book Award, and the" Los Angeles Times" Book Prize, among others. <br> <br>Kolonitskii is senior researcher at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences.An original but not very successful attempt to illuminate the political culture of the Russian Revolution by looking at its language and symbols. The book purports to be about ``the ways in which language was used to define identities and create new meanings in the politics of 1917,'' but much of the text relates to subjects only peripherally connected with this definition. The initial chapter, for example, deals with the ways in which the tsar was undermined by the rumors that the tsarina was pro-German, or that Rasputin was running the government, or that Russian defeats were caused by treason in high places. Similarly, the semireligious cult of revolutionary leaders, first Kerensky, and then Lenin and Kornilov, seems only marginally a linguistic phenomenon. More relevant is the discussion of what was meant by class. Figes (History/Birkbeck Coll., England; A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 18911924, 1997) and Kolonitskii (a researcher at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg) argue that the concept of class didnt exist until it was defined by language. There was instead a strong sense of Russians as laboring people united by a common sense of injustice and exclusion from society. The authors argue convincingly that class was a term flexible enough to unite diverse groups in a common struggle for human rights. They also believe that the terminology of revolution was foreign to most peasants but that they were not monarchists. The authors' most original argument may be that the peasantry shared a strong belief in socialism, and that hatred of the bourgeoisie had a strange mass appeal. They conclude that the symbolic language of revolution came from the socialists, and ``theirs was not a discourse of compromise.'' Perhaps that helps us explain, they suggest, why the Russian Revolution was so violent. Not a bad idea, but still a theme in search of evidence. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

De Quincey's response to Williams's attacks turns morality on its head, celebrating and coolly dissecting the art of murder and its perfections. This volume also contains De Quincey's best-known piece of literary criticism, "On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth," and his finest tale of terror, "The Avenger," a disturbing exploration of violence, vigilantism, and religious persecution. Ranging from gruesomely vivid reportage and brilliantly funny satiric high jinks to penetrating literary and aesthetic criticism, these essays had a remarkable impact on crime, terror, and detective fiction. They are also a key contribution to the satiric tradition, as well as on the rise of nineteenth-century decadence. The bibliography is the most extensive available on critical responses to De Quincey's essays on murder and violence, and the essays included here have never been annotated so thoroughly before. They reveal--often for the first time--De Quincey's debts, remarkable erudition, and encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary crime.<br><strong></strong> About the Series: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Is it property and capital assets alone, or something more? What matters most in managing family wealth, and what are the most effective strategies for maintaining it and conferring its advantages down through the generations? </p><p>In his bestselling, <i>Family Wealth,</i> first published in 1997, James E. Hughes answered those questions, and in the process forever changed the way high net worth families think about passing on their heritage, their wealth, and their legacy to future generations. </p><p>Now, 20 years later, in this successor volume, Hughes and coauthors Keith Whitaker and Susan E. Massenzio bring together the powerful insights, helpful tips, and timeless guidance contained in the original along with everything they've learned over the past decades about generational wealth, shared decision-making, sustainability, and purpose. </p><p><i>Complete Family Wealth</i> is a one-stop reference for ensuring a positive legacy for future generations. It provides practical advice for families struggling with all-too-common challenges of wealth management. But unlike other books on the subject, this one holds to the philosophy that true family wealth and its management is about more than shrewd investing, the right portfolio strategy, and tax-avoidance schemes. </p><p>Every family hopes to confer advantages to future generations that are more than just material and financial. They hope to instill character and leadership, to inspire creativity and enterprise, to help all family members find and follow their individual callings, and to avoid the financial dependency and loss of initiative that often follow financial success. Unfortunately, far too many families fall short of that goal. </p><p>In order to help your family avoid a similar fate, this book is firmly grounded in the principle of the "five capitals" of family wealth&#x2014;namely human, intellectual, social, spiritual, and financial. From the family enterprise to family governance, philanthropy, and more, the authors explore the "what," "who," and "how" of family wealth management. And they help you gain an appreciation for the distinct roles various family members can play in growing and maintaining family wealth, and to form a clear idea of each family member's unique responsibilities in the family enterprise. </p><p>Certainly, keeping your money in your family is a good thing. But it isn't all that matters. It's only one part of a greater undertaking&#x2014;in many ways, it's the least important part when it comes to true human happiness.

The floor began more than thirty years ago when Crawford moved his family to New Mexico after selling movie rights to his first novel. The history of their home-made house is written in the hand-plastered floor, patched and sealed over the years. At first a reminder of how little he and his wife knew about working with mud, the floor has become beautiful in the years since 1971. It embodies their lives, the ways things have changed and the ways things have stayed the same. "A mud floor is perfectly sustainable, being infinitely repairable and finally recyclable."</p><p>"Reflections in Mud," Crawford's essay about the floor, is one of the many pieces collected in this book about his life in northern New Mexico. The novelist who didn't know how to lay a mud floor is now a seasoned farmer, irrigator, and northern New Mexico villager, and the essays on these subjects that he has been writing since the 1980s continue the work he began in <i>Mayordomo</i> and <i>A Garlic Testament</i> as an articulator of values that are out of synch and out of scale with the suburban lives of most Americans in the twenty-first century.

Profoundly Disturbing examines the underground cult movies that have&#x2013;unexpectedly and unintentionally&#x2013;revolutionized the way that all movies would be made. Called "exploitation films" because they often exploit our most primal fears and desires, these overlooked movies pioneered new cinematographic techniques, subversive narrative structuring, and guerrilla marketing strategies that would eventually trickle up into mainstream cinema. In this book Joe Bob Briggs uncovers the most seminal cult movies of the twentieth century and reveals the fascinating untold stories behind their making. <br><br>Briggs is best known as the cowboy-hat wearing, Texas-drawling host of Joe Bob's Drive-in Theater and Monstervision, which ran for fourteen years on cable TV. His goofy, disarming take offers a refreshingly different perspective on movies and film making. He will make you laugh out loud but then surprise you with some truly insightful analysis. And, with more than three decades of immersion in the cult movie business, Briggs has a wealth of behind-the-scenes knowledge about the people who starred in, and made these movies. There is no one better qualified or more engaging to write about this subject.<br><br>All the subgenres in cult cinema are covered, with essays centering around twenty movies including Triumph of the Will (1938), Mudhoney (1965), Night of the Living Dead (1967), Deep Throat (1973), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Drunken Master (1978), and Crash (1996). Accompanying the text are dozens of capsule reviews providing ideas for related films to discover, as well as kitschy and fun archival film stills. An essential reference and guide to this overlooked side of cinema, Profoundly Disturbing should be in the home of every movie fan, especially those who think they've seen everything.</p><p>JOE BOB BRIGGS began his career as a film critic for the Dallas Times-Herald and Texas Monthly. In 1986, he started Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater, the highest-rated show on The Movie Channel, which ran for ten years. Later he moved to create Monstervision on TNT, which ran for four years and had a viewership of two million. His last book, Iron Joe Bob, was published ten years ago. A New York City resident, he is currently a columnist for UPI. <br><br>"Whether a film needs an appreciation, a second look or some kind of pathetic excuse, Joe Bob is the guy to give it. . . . Although Joe Bob takes an irreverent approach, his shows have featured some eloquent discussions of popular culture."&#x2013;The New York TimesBriggs, host of the long-running cable shows Joe Bob's Drive-In Theatre and Monstervision, is an acknowledged king of cult movie history. From Blood Feast to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Briggs analyzes 20 films and points out their cultural significance. The book is not, as the London Evening Standard put it, "beyond the bounds of depravity," but rather a wryly amusing, informative study of productions that some publicly disparage and privately relish. Roger Vadim's 1956 And God Created Woman broke down sexual barriers. His directorial shaping of Brigitte Bardot into a sex symbol, despite handicaps of coarse voice, cold manner and expressionless face, is a lusty and intriguing French version of Pygmalion. The Svengali theme also relates to Deep Throat, when Linda Lovelace, its star, became a steamy sex goddess in the hands of husband Chuck Traynor. These two movies permanently altered the way the world views celluloid sex, and Briggs demonstrates how Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch did the same for violence. Briggs touches thoughtfully on controversial interpretations that The Wild Bunch film elicited before placing it in perspective as an artistically daring forerunner of modern action films. Shaft unleashed the blaxploitation boom, while The Exorcist turned Satan into a Hollywood high concept. The author also writes with insight and affection about such lurid enterprises as The Curse of Frankenstein and The Creature from the Black Lagoon. The book merits attention from fans tired of high-minded essays about classics such as Citizen Kane, and explains why crass, tasteless pictures often make more impact than those released with the stamp of respectability. 50 illus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bostonians (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Bostonians&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RHenry James&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Classics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;Rseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

At its apex stands the vibrantly beautiful Verena Tarrant, an intense public speaker who arouses the passions of two very different people. Olive Chancellor, a Boston-bred suffragette, dreams of turning Verena into a fiery campaigner for women&#x2019;s rights. Basil Ransom, a Mississippi-bred lawyer, dreams of turning her into his wife. As these two struggle for possession of Verena&#x2019;s soul&#x2015;and body&#x2015;their confusions, crises, and conflicts begin almost preternaturally to prefigure today&#x2019;s sexual politics. In fact, James&#x2019;s complex portrait of Olive and her ideals, savagely satirical yet sympathetic and so controversial when it first appeared, continues to evoke both anger and admiration. But he treats Verena and Basil with equal complexity, climaxed by the novel&#x2019;s quietly haunting final sentence.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RSiri Hustvedt&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R earned a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University in 1986 and is the author of a book of poetry, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RReading to You;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R three novels: &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Blindfold, The Enchantment of Lily Dahl,&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R and &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RWhat I Loved;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R and a book of essays, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RYonder&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Scholars Karel Srp and Lenka Byd&#x17e;ovsk� bring to light the complex evolution and artistic exchanges of this era, which saw the emergence of the uniquely Czech movements of Devetsil, Poetism, and Artificialism, as well as these artists' engagements with Surrealism and other major intellectual currents of the time. Particular attention is given to artists' publications, and a number of period texts have been translated for this catalogue as well.

He was not happy in the business world and at the age of thirty-one he wrote and published at his own expense, <i>A Life</i>. It was followed four years later by <i>Senility</i>, a novel of tortured eroticism. Both <i>A Life</i> and <i>Senility</i> were such failures that Svevo gave up writing for the next twenty years. During this time he became a good friend of James Joyce, who was also living in Trieste, and who was able to use his influence to make Svevo known in Europe. Svevo was just becoming recognised in Italy when he was killed in a car accident in 1928."Svevo is perhaps the most significant Italian modernist novelist." -<b>&nbsp;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"If you have never read Svevo, do as soon as you can.

Francis was a brash, plain-spoken man whose political savvy guided him to positions of prominence at all levels of American government. He served as both mayor of St. Louis and governor of Missouri, and later entered national and international politics as ambassador to Russia from 1916 to 1918.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Appointed to that post by President Woodrow Wilson, Francis possessed a background in agricultural trade and banking and also impressed Wilson with his experience wooing heads of state as president of the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. As U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Francis went on to confront the impossible task of hammering out a trade treaty with the country while revolutions and World War I raged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This challenge and others are recounted in the biography, <i>Standing on a Volcano: The Life and Times of David R. Francis</i>, by accomplished St. Louis journalist Harper Barnes. In this fascinating book, Barnes discusses how Russia&#x2019;s internal volatility frustrated the diplomatic efforts of Francis, a maverick statesman who sympathized with Russia&#x2019;s poor and sought to stall the Bolshevik uprising. Though criticized by some historians for bold, unthinking calls for American intervention advice President Wilson dismissed Francis showed an unflagging commitment to Russia and to the hope of ushering in a democratic government.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Despite his mixed legacy, that Francis remains a figure of great historical significance locally, nationally, and internationally is&nbsp;evidenced at the Museum of the Diplomatic Corps in Vologda, Russia, where he is the primary subject.

It stresses the role of performance and the performer in the re-creative process of composition-in-performance. It addresses questions of authority and authorship in the making of oral poetry, and it examines the efforts of ancient scholars to edit a definitive text of the &#34;real&#34; Homer.</p><p>From the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods of ancient Greece, this comparative study of oral poetics in literate cultures focuses on the problems of textual fluidity in the transmission of Homeric poetry over half a millennium. It stresses the role of performance and performer.With Homeric poetry, it is argued that no single definitive text could evolve until the oral traditions in which the epic was grounded became obsolete. In the watershed era of Aristarchus, around 150 BC, the gradual movement from relatively more fluid to more rigid stages of Homeric transmission reached a near-final point of textualization.</p><h2>Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Communication Disorders</h2><p>Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Communication Disorders covers topics in aphasia, motor speech disorders, and dementia.

He is the author of numerous groundbreaking legal textbooks for paralegals and was a member of the transition team for then President-Elect Ronald Reagan. Mr. Statsky holds a master of law degree (LL.M) in urban affairs, as well as a juris doctorate degree (J.D.).I found the organization of the text to be excellent. I particularly like the order in which the author has presented the material. The author has provided an exceptional overview of the profession of a paralegal; the ethics, the responsibilities and regulation of the profession. This is well done.<br><br>The information Statsky compiles in this text creates a thorough foundation for the introductory paralegal student.

This is the period of the Golden Age of folk and fairy tales, when European folklorists sought to understand and redefine the present through the common tales of the past, and long neglected stories became recognized as cultural treasures.</p><p>In this rich collection, distinguished expert of fairy tales Jack Zipes continues his lifelong exploration of the story-telling tradition with a focus on the Golden Age. Included are one hundred eighty-two tales--many available in English for the first time--grouped into eighteen tale types. Zipes provides an engaging general Introduction that discusses the folk and fairy tale tradition, the impact of the Brothers Grimm, and the significance of categorizing tales into various types.</p><p>Short introductions to each tale type that discuss its history, characteristics, and variants provide readers with important background information.</p><p>Also included are annotations, short biographies of folklorists of the period, and a substantial bibliography.</p><p>Eighteen original art works by students of the art department of Anglia Ruskin University not only illustrate the eighteen tale types, but also provide delightful&#x2015;and sometimes astonishing&#x2015;21st-century artistic interpretations of them.</p></p><p><p>Jack Zipes is Professor Emeritus of German and Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota, and the author of more than fifteen books on folk and fairy tales.</p><p>"Jack Zipes is back with a massive, beautifully produced volume. It is basically an anthology of mostly translated texts, but with a thirty-seven-page presentation and illuminating introductions to each of the eighteen thematic sections. At the end, we get fifteen pages of short biographies of the collectors of the tales and a twenty-eight-page bibliography of collections, reference works, and criticism. . . . A master in his field has to be congratulated on yet another achievement." --Hans Kuhn, Australian National University, in <i>Journal of Folklore Research</i></p><br><br>"Those with a particular interest in the early attempts at what is now considered the heart of the discipline of folklore will be delighted by what Zipes has gathered. . . . The stories are divided by ATU numbers into eighteen different categories that contain the most well-known tales. . . . Each category has at least seven tales, often more, and Zipes provides each with a concise but helpful introduction that describes the "general format" of the tale type and an overview of its history. The tales themselves are annotated, always including the precise source in which the text was found. Every category begins with the earliest Grimm version of the text and, if possible, a later version of two from the brothers. Also included in the book is a large variety of less familiar versions of tales. . . . I was excited to discover so many tales and tellers I had never come across before. . . . The book has an extensive bibliography, which by itself is an enormous contribution to nineteenth-century fairy-tale scholarship, and, helpfully a section with short biographies of the contributing collectors. . . . <i>The Golden Age of Folk and Fairy Tales</i> fills a neglected gap by gathering the brightest examples of oral fairy-tale collection in its golden age. Such a text aids immeasurably the work of scholars who are interested in both folklore and the nineteenth century but his highly recommended for anyone fascinated by the fairy-tale form and its history."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014;Brittany Warman, <i>The Ohio State University</i>, in <i>Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies</i><br><br>"With the publication of <i>The Golden Age of Folk and Fairy Tales</i>, Zipes has presented us with a rich and comprehensive anthology which functions equally well as a reference/resource book and a textbook, thus being well-suited for both the seasoned researcher and the novice scholar. It seems to lend itself particularly well for use in the classroom. This accessible and highly useful volume will certainly make an excellent addition to the library of any scholar or student interested in folk narratives in general, and folk and fairy tales in particular."<br> &#x2014;Nada Kujund&#x17e;i&#x107;, in <i>Libri &amp; Liberi</i></p><h2>Culturally Proficient Leadership: The Personal Journey Begins Within</h2><p><br> <p><strong><em>Gain the personal insight you need to promote equity in your school!</em></strong></p> <p>To develop a high-performing school, educators must be able to lead and communicate across cultures.

Applying modern political theory to ancient Mediterranean history, it takes a Realist approach to its analysis of the development of Roman involvement in the Greek Mediterranean and employs unipolarity theory to examine the earliest era of Roman geopolitical dominance over the Greek states. Focusing on the harsh nature of interactions among states under conditions of international anarchy, the book examines the conduct of both Rome and the Greek states during the period, and the beginning of the replacement of anarchy by a situation of hierarchy and unipolarity. <p>In addition to providing an overview of the entire revolutionary period between 230 and 170 BC, the volume focuses detailed discussion on the geopolitical crisis that convulsed the Greek world in the last decade of the third century bc. This crisis led first to the violent collapse of the traditional Greek state-system based on the three great powers of Macedon, Syria, and Egypt, then to a revolution in Greek diplomacy towards Rome (201&#x2013;200 BC) as second-tier states pleaded for Roman intervention in the crisis, then to the beginning of Rome's permanent involvement in the high politics of the Greek Mediterranean, and finally to the creation of a situation of Roman unipolarity in the Greek Mediterranean. The first stage of that unipolarity (ca. 190&#x2013;170 BC) is then analyzed in detail.</p> <p><i>Rome Enters the Greek East</i> offers a balanced portrait of Roman militarism and imperialism that is essential reading for scholars interested in the interaction of Rome and the Hellenistic world.</p><b>Arthur M.

But forty years ago, Americans were experiencing the beginnings of another era--of the fevered anti-communism that came to be known as McCarthyism. During this period, the Cincinnati Reds felt compelled to rename themselves briefly the "Redlegs" to avoid confusion with the other reds, and one citizen in Indiana campaigned to have <em>The Adventures of Robin Hood</em> removed from library shelves because the story's subversive message encouraged robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. These developments grew out of a far-reaching anxiety over communism that characterized the McCarthy Era.<br><br>Richard Fried's <em>Nightmare in Red</em> offers a riveting and comprehensive account of this crucial time. He traces the second Red Scare's antecedents back to the 1930s, and presents an engaging narrative about the many different people who became involved in the drama of the anti-communist fervor, from the New Deal era and World War II, through the early years of the cold war, to the peak of McCarthyism, and beyond McCarthy's censure to the decline of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1960s. Along the way, we meet the familiar figures of the period--Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower, the young Richard Nixon, and, of course, the Wisconsin Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. But more importantly, Fried reveals the wholesale effect of McCarthyism on the lives of thousands of ordinary people, from teachers and lawyers to college students, factory workers, and janitors. Together with coverage of such famous incidents as the ordeal of the Hollywood Ten (which led to the entertainment world's notorious blacklist) and the Alger Hiss case, Fried also portrays a wealth of little-known but telling episodes involving victims and victimizers of anti-communist politics at the state and local levels.<br><br>Providing the most complete history of the rise and fall of the phenomenon known as McCarthyism, <em>Nightmare in Red</em> shows that it involved far more than just Joe McCarthy.<br></p><p>Providing the most complete history of the rise and fall of the phe-nomenon known as McCarthyism, Nightmare in Red offers a riveting and comprehensive account of the many different people who became embroiled in the anti-communist fervor of mid-century America.

The authors of these 1973 papers criticise this interpretation as oversimplified, and analyse the two institutions in the contexts of Africa, with its preponderance of bridewealth, and South Asia, where dowry is the commoner institution. Dr Goody seeks to explain these geographical differences in terms of the basic structure of the societies and the rules governing the inheritance of property. Dr Tambiah considers these institutions in India, Ceylon and Burma as two kinds of property transfer, examining Indian juridical concepts, and relating these to the concepts and practices of Ceylon and Burma.</p><p>In these insightful papers, first published in 1973, two leading authorities make a wide-ranging review of ideas and materials on bridewealth and dowry. The authors analyse the two institutions in the contexts of Africa, with its preponderance of bridewealth, and South Asia, where dowry is the commoner institution.</p><h2>One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs, and Gender</h2><p><em>One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs, and Gender</em> examines the causes, nature, and meaning of female gang involvement. Miller situates the study of female gang membership in the context of current directions in feminist scholarship and research on both gangs and female criminal offenders. Unique in its approach, this book is a comparative study that examines both gang members and nongang members to provide an accurate picture of the nature of gang life. The author draws on interviews from two contrasting cities, St. Louis, Missouri and Columbus, Ohio. While both cities have relatively new gang histories, their socioeconomic conditions are notably different. The book opens with a foreword written by Malcolm W. Klein, a leading authority on youth gangs. Miller examines how and why girls join gangs; the nature of girls' involvement in gangs; how gang involvement shapes girls' participation in delinquency and their risk of victimization; and the ways in which gender affects their gang experience. Miller concludes by drawing out implications for gender and crime and the study of female lawbreaking. Written in a lively and personal style, <em>One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs, and Gender</em> includes rich, extensive interviews offering fascinating excerpts from the girls themselves. Miller examines these dialogues in order to explore gender identities within gangs. <em>One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs, and Gender</em> is an ideal text for courses which focus on juvenile delinquency, women and crime, gang activity, and female lawbreaking.<br></p><p>Jody Miller is at University of Missouri, St.Louis."The topic of young women's participation in street gangs and violence has generated much heat and little light-until now. Dr. Miller's use of multiple theoretical and methodological lenses produces a comparative perspective that is rare in social research. Her sophisticated analyses of the<br>impact of gender on gang girls' lives contributes to our understanding of how gang involvement shapes these girls' experience. One of the Guys is surely one of the best scholarly works about gangs."--Cheryl L. Maxson, University of Southern California<br><br>"We have long known that girls are in gangs, but very little first-hand research on their lives, their choices, and their differences has been available. For this reason, Miller's detailed work on girls in gangs not only fills an enormous scholarly void in gang research, it also provides those<br>that are working with this problem with solid, careful information on the painful bargains that girls in economically marginalized and violent neighborhoods are forced to make every day."--Meda Chesney-Lind, University of Hawaii at Manoa</p><h2>The Pillar and Ground of the Truth: An Essay in Orthodox Theodicy in Twelve Letters</h2><p><p>Pavel Florensky--certainly the greatest Russian theologian of the last century--is now recognized as one of Russia's greatest polymaths. Known as the Russian Leonardo da Vinci, he became a Russian Orthodox priest in 1911, while remaining deeply involved with the cultural, artistic, and scientific developments of his time. Arrested briefly by the Soviets in 1928, he returned to his scholarly activities until 1933, when he was sentenced to ten years of corrective labor in Siberia. There he continued his scientific work and ministered to his fellow prisoners until his death four years later. This volume is the first English translation of his rich and fascinating defense of Russian Orthodox theology.</p><br><p> Originally published in 1914, the book is a series of twelve letters to a "brother" or "friend," who may be understood symbolically as Christ. Central to Florensky's work is an exploration of the various meanings of Christian love, which is viewed as a combination of <i>philia</i> (friendship) and <i>agape</i> (universal love). Florensky is perhaps the first modern writer to explore the so-called "same-sex unions," which, for him, are not sexual in nature. He describes the ancient Christian rites of the <i>adelphopoiesis</i> (brother-making), joining male friends in chaste bonds of love. In addition, Florensky is one of the first thinkers in the twentieth century to develop the idea of the Divine Sophia, who has become one of the central concerns of feminist theologians.</p></p><p><p>"One of the most important and controversial works of Russian religious philosophy."<b>--Richard Pevear, translator of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i></b></p><b>Boris Jakim</b> is an experienced translator of Russian religious thought.

Even more strangely, no one&#x2014;not even his closest informant and friend&#x2014;would speak about it.<br> <br> Wachtel discovered that a series of recent deaths and misfortunes in Chipaya had been attributed to the evil powers of the Urus, a group usually regarded with suspicion by the other ethnic groups. Those incarcerated were believed to be the chief sorcerers and vampires whose paganistic practices had brought death to Chipaya by upsetting the social order. Wachtel's investigation, told in <i>Gods and Vampires: Back to Chipaya</i>, reveals much about relations between the Urus and the region's dominant ethnic groups and confronts some of the most trenchant issues in contemporary anthropology. His analysis shows that the Urus had become victims of the same set of ideals the Spanish had used, centuries before, to establish their hegemony in the region.<br> <br> Presented as a personal detective story, <i>Gods and Vampires</i> is Wachtel's latest work in a series studying the ongoing impact of the Spanish conquest on the Andean consciousness and social system. Its insight into Bolivian society and the legacy of hegemony confronts some of the most trenchant issues in contemporary anthropologyand will be of great interest to scholars of anthropology, Latin American studies, and Native American studies.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Best Practices for Teaching Social Studies: What Award-Winning Classroom Teachers Do</h2><p>This collection of outstanding, teacher-tested methods for K&#x2013;12 social studies instruction for diverse classrooms offers fresh ideas and strategies covering citizenship, diversity, community, and more.</p><p><b>Randi Stone&nbsp;</b>is the author of&nbsp;nine Corwin Press books: <em>Best Practices for Teaching Reading: What Award-Winning Classroom Teachers Do, </em><em>Best Practices for Teaching Social Studies: What Award-Winning Classroom Teachers Do, Best Practices for Teaching</em> <i>Writing: What Award-Winning Classroom Teachers</i> <i>Do, Best Practices for Teaching Mathematics: What</i> <i>Award-Winning Classroom Teachers Do, </i>and <i>Best Practices for Teaching</i> <em>Science: What Award-Winning Classroom Teachers Do. </em>She is a graduate of Clark University, Boston University, and Salem State College.

It reveals how prominent scholars and physicians--many of whom were active in the international eugenics movement--not only acquiesced to anti-Semitic laws and extermination camps, but provided a scientific foundation for Hitler's racist policies, advised on the laws that were passed to implement these policies, helped administrate the Final Solution as well as euthanasia programs aimed at the mentally ill, and in extreme cases, such as Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz, personally murdered inmates "in the interests of science." <br> A major figure in this sordid tale is Professor Eugen Fischer, an anatomist and a world renowned advocate of eugenics--the use of genetics to "improve mankind"--whose work on interracial marriage in South West Africa inspired Hitler's racial theories in <em>Mein Kampf</em>. Professor Fischer later headed the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, which supervised the forced sterilization of hundreds of thousands of people, the "mercy killing" of 70,000 mentally ill, and finally the mass murder of millions of Jews. Another prominent figure, the psychiatrist Dr. Ritter, whose research was funded by the Reich, claimed that 90% of the Gypsies he studied were of "mixed blood" and that they should be consigned to labor camps. As a result, over 20,000 Gypsies died at Auschwitz. There was also Professor Hirt, an anatomist at the University of Strasbourg, who requested and received over one hundred skeletons of "typical Jews" for his studies in anatomy...Professor Schneider, a psychiatrist who recorded the physiological characteristics of mentally ill patients, murdered them, then studied their brain tissue and structure...and Professor Clauberg, who advised Himmler that "an appropriately trained doctor" could sterilize several hundred Jewish women per day. <br> Benno M�ller-Hill carefully examines the thinking and motivation of all these scientists, and he includes a transcript of the conversations he held with many of the participants. The result is a gripping chronicle of one of the most shocking episodes in 20th-century science.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>: <br><strong>Benno M�ller-Hill</strong> is Professor of Genetics at the Institut f�r Genetik der Universitat zu K�ln, West Germany.<br>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Listening to Movies: The Film Lover&#x2019;s Guide to Film Music</h2><p>Music has been an essential part of virtually every movie ever made. In the words of the great director D. W. Griffith, "The music sets the mood for what your eye sees; it guides your emotions; it is the emotional framework for visual pictures." Or, as composer Bernard Herrmann said, "Movies need the cement of music."<br>Listening to Movies is the lay person's guide to the exciting world of film music. Featuring 100 photographs, including stills from classic films as well as portraits and candid shots of the creators of film music, this book tells how music for the movies is written, performed, recorded, and mixed; how composers work with directors and producers; and how the whole process evolved. Fred Karlin surveys the history of this very special kind of music, from the era when pianists and live orchestras accompanied silent films, through the great days of the Hollywood studio orchestras and the ground-breaking work of composers like Korngold, Herrmann, and Rozsa, on to the present, when electronic scores, crafted through a dizzying array of high-tech hardware and software, exist side by side with symphonic scores. Throughout, Karlin draws on his interviews with key figures in the industry to personalize the world of film music.<br>Listening to Movies reveals not only how film music is made but how it can be crucial in establishing tone, setting a pace, and involving the audience. Through numerous examples, Karlin helps the reader to understand and appreciate exactly how the music on the soundtrack enhances the movies we see. Here are just a few of the other perspectives this book provides: a unique cue-by-cue breakdown of the music for eight classic movies, from The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) to The Untouchables (1987), demonstrating in detail how the music works with the action; a revealing chapter on the Academy Awards that takes the reader behind the scenes for an inside look at the Oscars telecast and untangles the complicated rules that govern the awards for songs and scores; a selective Filmography listing composers for 1,500 movies; and a complete listing of Oscar winners for Best Original Score and a guide to help the reader locate soundtrack recordings.<br>Designed to appeal to everyone interested in film or film music - from the casual viewer of television movies and videotapes to the dedicated film student and the professional filmmaker - Listening to Movies is the most comprehensive and readable book on the subject ever written for a general audience. Both a fascinating narrative and a valuable reference, it provides a complete picture of the world of movie music.</p><p>Fred Karlin teaches film music at the University of Southern California.There are few books about movie music, but most of them are good. Ditto Karlin's, which, striving for comprehensiveness, covers how film music is composed, recorded, and mixed into a soundtrack; how to listen to it appreciatively; how it actually functions in eight movies famous for their music (including such classics as <i>The Adventures of Robin Hood</i> [1938] and <i>North by Northwest</i>); how it has been reviewed by intelligent critics; and how it was and is used in silent and nondramatic sound films. And after all that, it's only half over! Karlin now puts on a business-chronicler's hat to discuss movie musicmaking under the Hollywood studio system and subsequently as a freelance occupation, the Oscars for music and how they're awarded, and the commercial importance of songs and soundtrack recordings. The book's last two sections are a short chronology of film-music history and, prefaced by some comments on "How They Got Started," a listing of selected film composers and (only) some of their credits. Appendixes include a list of soundtrack shops and vendors and a worthy annotated bibliography. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Age of Sinatra (Soft Skull ShortLit)</h2><p>After the most recent Forgetting, Ohle's luckless protagonist Moldenke is in possession of only his name and the bare facts of his former life. He finds himself cruising on the Titanic through a bizarre alternate reality where elective deformation is a fashion trend, neuts and human settlers do their best to live together in relative harmony, and the only available sustenance is stomach-churning fare. Everyone agrees the Stinkers are troublesome and something must be done. President Ratt not only fails to control the Stinker problem, but he also has a penchant for decreeing absurd laws and issuing random vouchers of innocence. Violators with valid vouchers defer their punishments to guiltless bystanders--regulations that land Moldenke and his fellows in prison more than once.<br>Rumours are circulating that another Forgetting is imminent, and that the Forgettings are induced by Ratt's radio broadcasts. The prison guard Montfaucon emerges as Ratt's political rival, and Moldenke, ever the yes-man, finds himself inadvertently involved in a plot to assassinate the president. The rebels hope to return to the Age of Sinatra, "when happiness was not only considered achievable, but hailed as the ideal state of being."</p><p>David Ohle&#39;s first novel, Motorman, was published by Knopf in 1972 under the now-legendary editorial aegis of Gordon Lish.

In the interviews collected here - covering everything from his own burgeoning literary celebrity to Kubrick&#39;s Lolita to lepidoptery - he is never casual or off-guard. Instead he insisted on receiving questions in advance and always carefully composed his responses. Keen to dismiss those who fail to understand his work and happy to butcher those sacred cows of the literary canon he dislikes, Nabokov is much too entertaining to be infuriating, and these interviews, letters and articles are as engaging, challenging and caustic as anything he ever wrote.</p><p>In this collection of interviews, articles, and editorials, Nabokov ranges over his life, art, education, politics, literature, movies, and modern times, among other subjects. Strong Opinions offers his trenchant, witty, and always engaging views on everything from the Russian Revolution to the correct pronunciation of Lolita.<b>Vladimir Nabokov</b> was born on April 23, 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.</p><h2>Integrated Mathematics: Course 1</h2><p>Very legible.

Shortly after the rise to power of the warrior pharaoh Ramesses II, Egyptian authors began to write stories about battles and conquest. However, these stories were not set in the present, but in the past: they were the world's first works of historical fiction. These literary recreations of past events, which preserve fascinating mixtures of fact and fiction, provide unparalleled information about topics as diverse as ancient Egyptian historiography, religion, and notions of humor and wit. <br><br><em>Imagining the Past </em>is the first volume to provide complete translations and commentary for the historical fiction composed during Egypt's New Kingdom. The four works include <em>The Quarrel of Apepi and Seqenenre</em>, <em>The Capture of Joppa</em>, <em>Thutmose III in Asia</em>, <em>The Libyan Battle Story</em>. An introduction explores Egyptian conceptions of the past, the universe of historical and literary texts in New Kingdom Egypt, and the definition of a new genre of Egyptian literature. Extensive commentary and new translations appear within each chapter, and a concluding analysis summarizes the audience and function of historical fiction as well as theology and historiography within the tales. Despite the fragmentary nature of the papyrus copies, the thorough research into the literary, political, and social context of each tale allows a modern reader to explore this forgotten literary subfield and appreciate the stories as works of historical fiction.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colleen Manassa</strong> is William K. and Marilyn M.

They teach how to master each of the four basic interview components separately, and how to make them interact optimally during the five phases of the patient interview. Also included is an example of a write-up of a psychiatric evaluation that will satisfy most third-party payers, taking the reader through the write-up step by step and showing how it can be adapted to virtually any procedural or research need. Changes to this edition: -Addition of discussion of violence and duty to warn -Expansion of attention problems, suicide intent, and comorbidities of personality disorders -Addition of formal assessments of executive functions and of dementia (in appendix) As with the previous edition, The Clinical Interview Using DSM-IV-TR presents a unique vision of how to use the most powerful assessment strategies developed in the field of clinical psychology and psychiatry.</p><p>&#34;Here the unimaginative shackles of orthodox psychiatric history taking and mental state examination are thrown off with the proposal that the diagnostic process starts from the initial contact with the patient. This of course, is obvious to the experienced practitioner but is rarely conveyed in textbooks on psychiatric interviewing, which tend to convey a systematic, rather pedestrian approach, where mental state examination and diagnosis linearly follow data collection. In contrast, the authors&#39; approach is a thinking approach, where mental state examination weaves through-out the interview informing, shaping, and refining the diagnostic process.... This is a textbook that should be read by all mental health professionals, whatever their core discipline. The reader would benefit from reading both volumes in their entirety (over 1,000 pages) but could profit simply from dipping in and rereading relevant chapters.... The reader is introduced to a gourmet menu of interviewing techniques, described in detail and illustrated by deconstructed interviews.&#34;-- &#34;Lisetta M.

The famed Mesopotamian king Gilgamesh, who claimed a right to immortality, was one of them; so was the hero of the Deluge, Noah (the Babylonian Utnapishtim). <br> <br>Are we then, all of us, descended of demigods? <br> <br><strong><em>In this breathtaking book, Zecharia Sitchin asserts that there exists, today, physical evidence that could prove those biblical and Sumerian tales.</em></strong> <br> <br>Proceeding step-by-step through a mass of ancient writings and artifacts, he leads the reader to &#x201c;Ur of the Chaldees&#x201d; and Abraham&#x2019;s time, where four thousand years later archaeologists uncovered in the sacred precinct extraordinary burials unique for the wealth and opulence of artifacts they contained and scores of attendants entombed with them. Known as <em>The Royal Tombs of Ur</em>, they remained a baffling mystery. <br> <br><strong>Now, in this crowning oeuvre that reads like a detective story, Zecharia Sitchin reaches the stunning conclusion that the two most extraordinary tombs were the last resting place of an Anunnaki goddess and her demigod spouse and proceeds to identify them and their genealogical ancestry back to those who were first to land on Earth from Nibiru. </strong> <br> <br>He then makes a sensational revelation that could provide <em>conclusive physical evidence for alien presence on Earth</em> in the ancient past, with an unprecedented scientific opportunity to track down the &#x201c;Missing Link&#x201d; in humankind&#x2019;s evolution and a key to unlocking the secrets of disease, longevity, and even the ultimate mystery of life and death. <br> <br>Eminent biblical scholar and internationally acclaimed author ZECHARIA SITCHIN (1920-2010) spent 60 years researching and translating Sumerian clay tablets and other ancient texts that identify the Anunnaki and their planet, Nibiru.

The answers to these questions are crucial when one is faced with the ethical issue of taking human life. In this affirmation of the intrinsic personal dignity and inviolability of every human individual, John Kavanaugh, S. J., denies that it can ever be moral to intentionally kill another.<br><br>Today in every corner of the world men and women are willing to kill others in the name of "realism" and under the guise of race, class, quality of life, sex, property, nationalism, security, or religion. We justify these killings by either excluding certain humans from our definition of personhood or by invoking a greater good or more pressing value.<br><br>Kavanaugh contends that neither alternative is acceptable. He formulates an ethics that opposes the intentional killing not only of medically "marginal" humans but also of depersonalized or criminalized enemies. Offering a philosophy of the person that embraces the undeveloped, the wounded, and the dying, he proposes ways to recover a personal ethical stance in a global society that increasingly devalues the individual.<br><br>Kavanaugh discusses the work of a range of philosophers, artists, and activists from Richard Rorty and S�ren Kierkegaard to Albert Camus and Woody Allen, from Mother Teresa to Jack Kevorkian. His approach is in stark contrast to that of writer Peter Singer and others who believe that not all human life has intrinsic moral worth. It will challenge philosophers, students of ethics, and anyone concerned about the depersonalization of contemporary life.</p><p><b>John F.

Maybe they&#x2019;re even suspicious of it. John Coltrane&#x2019;s saxophonic flights of fancy, Jimi Hendrix&#x2019;s feedback drenched guitar solos, Ravi Shankar&#x2019;s sitar extrapolations&#x2014;all these sounds seem like so much noodling or jamming, indulgent self-expression. &#x201c;Just&#x201d; improvising, as is sometimes said. For these music fans, it seems natural that music is meant to be composed. In the first book of its kind, John Corbett&#x2019;s <i>A Listener&#x2019;s Guide to Free Improvisation</i> provides a how-to manual for the most extreme example of spontaneous improvising: music with no pre-planned material at all. Drawing on over three decades of writing about, presenting, playing, teaching, and studying freely improvised music, Corbett offers an enriching set of tools that show any curious listener how to really <i>listen</i>, and he encourages them to enjoy the human impulse&#x2014; found all around the world&#x2014; to make up music on the spot.<br> <br> Corbett equips his reader for a journey into a difficult musical landscape, where there is no steady beat, no pre-ordained format, no overarching melodic or harmonic framework, and where tones can ring with the sharpest of burrs. In &#x201c;Fundamentals,&#x201d; he explores key areas of interest, such as how the musicians interact, the malleability of time, overcoming impatience, and watching out for changes and transitions; he grounds these observations in concrete listening exercises, a veritable training regime for musical attentiveness. Then he takes readers deeper in &#x201c;Advanced Techniques,&#x201d; plumbing the philosophical conundrums at the heart of free improvisation, including topics such as the influence of the audience and the counterintuitive challenge of listening while asleep. Scattered throughout are helpful and accessible lists of essential resources&#x2014;recordings, books, videos&#x2014; and a registry of major practicing free improvisors from No�l Akchot� to John Zorn, particularly essential because this music is best experienced live.<br> <br> The result is a concise, humorous, and inspiring guide, a unique book that will help transform one of the world&#x2019;s most notoriously unapproachable artforms into a rewarding and enjoyable experience. </p></p><p><b>John Corbett </b>is a writer, producer, and curator based in Chicago who has written extensively on jazz and improvised music. A regular contributor to <i>DownBeat</i> magazine, he is the author of several books, including <i>Extended Play: Sounding Off from John Cage to Dr. Funkenstein</i> and <i>Microgroove: Forays Into Other Music</i>.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A much-needed book for the open-minded listener&#x2014;a well-written volume from jazz critic John Corbett&#x2014;and one that&#x2019;s bound to widen your ears to a whole new realm of listening! The book&#x2019;s pocket-sized&#x2014;maybe so that you can sneak it into a club when visiting a free jazz concert&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s written in a style that&#x2019;s both personal, but very directive&#x2014;with a full understanding of the complexities that come into play when listening to improvised music, and a guide towards facing some of the more difficult challenges involved! Corbett clearly loves this music, but without any sort of high ideals&#x2014;none of the too-cool-for-school modes that are usually standard with the avant garde, and instead this very down to earth approach that shows the listener that they&#x2019;ve got all the tools needed to enjoy the music themselves. The goal here (one we can totally endorse) is to bring the listener face to face with new and challenging sounds&#x2014;but in a way that allows them to instantly contextualize them too&#x2014;yet without having to carry years of jazz or musical experience into the process. The book is divided up into easy-to-digest sections&#x2014;and penned with a surprisingly warm style too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Dusty Groove</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It took me years and lots of listening to understand free improvisation, and in the beginning Corbett was a big help for me. This handy book breaks down the basics of free improvisation, a theoretically non-idiomatic practice where musicians get together with nothing planned and simply make music spontaneously, focusing on interaction and largely dispensing with the qualities we expect in music&#x2014;fixed structure, melody, regular rhythms, standard harmony. Free improvisation is about sound and interplay, though that doesn't quite sum it up. Corbett mostly does without name dropping and jargon&#x2014;he designed his book for the novice, and he takes pains to keep things clear and approachable, even if what he's writing about is anything but accessible to most listeners.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Chicago Reader</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The perfect example of what any field guide to music (or any other art form) should be. Small enough to fit in a pocket at barely over 4&#x2033; x 6&#x2033;, the book is a practical guide for those new to free improvisation, though there is plenty of information for an experienced listener to pick up something new. . . . This book will undoubtedly be useful to anyone who is interested in improvised&nbsp;music or even music in general. These listening techniques could easily be applied to most forms of music. It would be nice to see this book be adopted as a text for music appreciation and history classes. I wish this book had been around when I started listening to and performing free improvisation. This is an essential text for the next generations of listeners.&#x201d; (<i>Burning Ambulance</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A refreshingly pragmatic book. . . . As a primer, it&#x2019;s a valuable guide and even seasoned listeners will find it useful to be reminded what distinguishes free improvisation from other music and the kinds of things to which they should be alive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Free Jazz Collective</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lays down a golden road to understanding free improvisation. . . . <i>A Listener&#x2019;s Guide</i>&nbsp;is, essentially, and in the best way possible, a popular how-to manual from a master who has spent years in the field. Reading Corbett is like spending an afternoon with your favorite uncle and his cabinet of booze.

Kudos, then, to John Corbett for his insight into how one can gain deeper understandings of and appreciation for such music. Written in a pithy, metaphor-steeped style, Corbett&#x2019;s book is humorous and engaging; he&#x2019;s having a bit of fun with a subject about which he cares deeply. Fond of enlarging on his metaphors, as when he shows the various ways the book is like a field guide for birdwatching, he&#x2019;s equally content to string a series of mixed metaphors together, thereby acknowledging the imprecise nature of such allusions, all merely parts, hints, of the bigger &#x2018;truth&#x2019; he wants to illuminate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New York City Jazz Record</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard enough to put music into words, but even harder when it&#x2019;s created without preconceived plans.

Yet Corbett handles the material with grace and humor, intelligence and curiosity, in prose that unlike some writing on the subject, is easy to read and accessible to everyone. . . . a strangely soothing read, finding beauty and order amidst seeming chaos like a Zen master who describes a blade of grass bending but not breaking in the wind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Spectrum Culture</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Corbett has been listening to free improvisation for years and beyond that, has organized shows, curated festivals, and even engineered recording sessions for the music. Now, with&nbsp;<i>A Listener's Guide to Free Improvisation</i>, he has attempted to build a bridge to potential listeners by writing a kind of guide for the perplexed on how to listen to music that doesn't follow the conventions of ordinary song. . . .

A unique feature of the book is that it provides definitions of terms from both human geography and physical geography; especially relevant now that environment is so critical to our understanding of geography.</p> <p></p> <p>Organized into four parts: Getting Started in Geographical Research; Data Collection in Human Geography; Data Collection in Physical Geography; Analysing and Representing Geographical Data - each chapter comprises:</p> <p></p> <p>� a short definition</p> <p>� a summary of the principal arguments</p> <p>� a substantive 5,000-word discussion</p> <p>� use of real-life examples</p> <p>� annotated notes for further reading</p> <p></p> <p> The teaching of research methods is integral in all geography courses. Written in an accessible way - by established figures in the discipline - the text provides thorough explanations of key methods and their applications, illustrated with everyday examples. <b>Key Methods in Geography</b> identifies the key analytical and observational strategies with which all UK geography undergraduates must understand to complete their degree.</p></p><p>Nick Clifford is Professor and Head of Department at King&#x2019;s College London.<p>&nbsp;</p> &#x2032;The second edition of Key Methods in Geography, part of what is now a well-established series, offers a broadly conceived overview of the planning, execution and presentation of geographical research. Its range is far broader than the majority of methods texts, being concerned with both human and physical geography. The book also tackles all-too-often neglected contexts of research such as health and safety ethics. In doing so, it makes clear that these should be seen more as form-filling hurdles to be negotiated before hitting the field. In addition, the volume covers areas - such as conducting a literature search, writing essays, reports and dissertations and understanding assessment - that technically lie beyond the remit suggested in the title, but that undoubtedly enhance its impact. Given the seriousness with which Key Methods in Geography approaches all aspects of research, it will continue to find wide favour among undergraduate geographers...the influence of the editors is apparent in the consistency of tone, style and pitch among the book&#x2032;s 35 contributors. All of the authors are experienced in the area they discuss and offer a general overview rather than one overly focused on their own research. Clearly the editors recognise their audience well and have briefed accordingly&#x2032; Author: Tim Hall, University of Gloucestershire Published On: 2013-07-16<br><br><p>&nbsp;</p> &#x2032;All geographers, whatever their interest, need to do research. This book will help them get started in the best possible way, with thoughtful advice on everything from project design, through choice of methods, to data analysis and presentation. The editors have assembled an impressive array of authors, all experts in their chosen field. It will be an especially stimulating source for geography students embarking on their undergraduate dissertations&#x2032; Author: Professor Tim Burt Published On: 2013-07-16<br><br><p>&#x2032;An excellent and very comprehensive text and highly recommended for all our undergraduates (around 120 students). The topics covered are very important for undergraduate dissertations and even postgraduate work. It is much more comprehensive than some other texts and is much more specific to the environmental/spatial sciences. This is definitely a text that will be strongly recommended to our students&#x2032;</p> Author: Dr. Paul McKenzie Published On: 2013-07-16</p><h2>Feedback That Works: How to Build and Deliver Your Message (Arabic Edition)</h2><p>Whatever level you occupy in an organization, from line manager to senior executive to team leader, the skill of giving meaningful and effective feedback is an important component to helping other people develop and to getting the job done. Creating and delivering a specific message based on observed performance is key to effective feedback. Your feedback should enable the receiver to walk away understanding exactly what he or she did and what impact it had on you. When the result is this specific and this direct, there is a better chance that the person getting the feedback will be motivated to begin, continue, or stop behaviors that affect performance. This guidebook explains how to deliver effective feedback by showing how to build your message, when to deliver it, and how to communicate it. By using the methods and examples in this guidebook, your feedback becomes a tool for development&#x2014;for others and for yourself.</p><p>This series of guidebooks draws on the practical knowledge that the <b>Center for Creative Leadership (CCL)</b> has generated, since its inception in 1970, through its research and educational activity conducted in partnership with hundreds of thousands of managers and executives. Much of this knowledge is shared-in a way that is distinct from the typical university department, professional association, or consultancy. CCL is not simply a collection of individual experts, although the individual credentials of its staff are impressive; rather it is a community, with its members holding certain principles in common and working together to understand and generate practical responses to today's leadership and organizational challenges.<br> The purpose of the series is to provide managers with specific advice on how to complete a developmental task or solve a leadership challenge. In doing that, the series carries out CCL's mission to advance the understanding, practice, and development of leadership for the benefit of society worldwide. <p>As the former product manager for e-products and services at the Center for Creative Leadership, <b>Sloan R. Weitzel</b> was responsible for developing and offering leadership development tools via the Web. Prior to that position, he was a senior program associate at CCL. Additionally, as a CCL certified feedback specialist, he worked one-on-one with executives to increase their self-awareness. Prior to joining CCL, he spent eight years at AT&amp;T in technical support, sales, and marketing. He holds an MBA from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.</p></p><h2>Buildings of West Virginia (Buildings of the United States)</h2><p><em>Buildings of West Virginia</em> provides a comprehensive guide to the state's built environment, from the prehistoric mounds that are its earliest structures to buildings that have shaped its image--log cabins, elegant spas, and coal company towns--to its everyday commercial, industrial, government, religious, and domestic structures. Buildings and sites are described and interpreted in some 1,000 guidebook entries illustrated with approximately 375 photographs and keyed to 60 maps. Throughout, West Virginia's architecture is related to its distinctive geography, natural resources, early prosperity and later economic decline, and colorful history, first as part of the colony and state of Virginia and then as the Mountain State.<br> <br> <strong>About the Buildings of the United States Series</strong>: <em>Buildings of West Virginia</em> is the ninth volume to be published in the monumental <em>Buildings of the United States</em>, a series that Edwin McDowell of the <em>New York Times</em> has called "one of the most ambitious in publishing history."

The contributors to this collection scrutinize a common mystical experience, the "pure consciousness event"--the experience of being awake but devoid of intentional content--in order to answer these questions. Through the use of historical Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish mystical writings, as well as those of modern mystics, the contributors reveal the inconsistencies and inadequacies of current models, and make significant strides towards developing new models for the understanding of mystical phenomenon, in particular, and of human experience, in general.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert K.C.

When the bubble burst and the large number of accounting scandals began to grow, most investors didn&#x2019;t know where to turn or whom to trust. Now it has become more important than ever for investors to take matters into their own hands. <p><i>Financial Fine Print: Uncovering a Company&#x2019;s True Value</i> lets individual investors in on the secrets that seasoned professional investors use when they evaluate a potential investment. Buried deep in a company&#x2019;s quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) reports are the real clues to a company&#x2019;s financial health: the footnotes. At many large companies, these footnotes can run for more than 30 pages and for some corporations have doubled in the past five years, making them simply too important for investors to ignore.</p> <p><i>Financial Fine Print</i> spells out exactly what investors need to look for within the footnotes of a company&#x2019;s reports in order to make better, more informed decisions. By using numerous examples of actual footnotes that have appeared in SEC documents, the book teaches investors in easy-to-understand language ways to spot &#x2013; and avoid &#x2013; future Enrons and Worldcoms (and Tycos and Adelphias and HealthSouths). For any investor who has spent the past three years watching their investments shrink and has begun to think about getting back into the market, this book provides the critical tools that investors need to know to avoid getting burned once again.</p></p><p>"Always read the fine print." It's one of life's basic maxims, and for the individual investor, still smarting from recent market meltdowns, the saying goes double. Too many claims of miraculous earnings have been revealed as accounting mirages, with small shareholders among the biggest losers. <p>Prudent investors want the whole story, not just the rose-colored version of events that managers tend to portray. Yet how do you uncover it, given the huge amount of available information? The trick is simply knowing where and how to look.</p> <p>Financial Fine Print is a great place to start. Written by veteran financial journalist Michelle Leder, this book lays bare the accounting tricks companies use to whitewash their numbers. Using a clear, no-nonsense style and pointing out numerous scandals and red flags, Leder sheds light on the most obscure yet most essential aspect of annual reports and SEC filings: the footnotes.</p> <p>With the knowledge and techniques detailed in Financial Fine Print, you'll learn: </p> <ul> <li>Why one number buried deep within the pension footnote can speak volumes about whether the company's other numbers are trustworthy</li> <li>What sorts of insider transactions investors need to pay close attention to</li> <li>Where companies tend to hide their debt and other obligations</li> <li>How some companies seem to take "special" charges every quarter and how that impacts the bottom line</li> <li>When to avoid a stock because the red flags are simply too numerous</li> </ul> <p>"Too many companies would prefer that you not read the footnotes," notes former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. "That should be incentive enough to delve into them." As investor skepticism builds and the specters of Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing loom large, companies trying to prove themselves above-board have added more footnotes and documentation than ever to their reporting. This makes learning the lessons of Financial Fine Print all the more important. Because the simple fact is that if you want to own individual stocks, you need to do your homework.</p>"A must-read for any investor serious about knowing what they own. With the help of some of the best financial detectives, Michelle Leder provides a roadmap for delving beneath the surface &#x2013;&#x2013; where most investors dare not tread."<br> &#x2013;Herb Greenberg, Columnist, TheStreet.com and Fortune magazine <p>"Obfuscators beware! Michelle Leder has cracked the code. In this invaluable guide to combing the footnotes of financial statements for indicators of accounting tricks and attempts to hide the bad news needles in a haystack of numbers. This is a clear, sensible, and, above all, practical guide that will be indispensable for anyone who invests in, does business with, or works for a corporation."<br> &#x2013;Nell Minow, Editor, The Corporate Library</p> <p>"Too many companies would prefer that you not read the footnotes," observes former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. "That should be incentive enough to delve into them." In fact, not only do companies prefer you ignore the details they are required to report&#x2013;the pesky particulars on exactly how they account for those whopping earnings&#x2013;they take calculated steps to make this information as hard as possible to understand. But for those who know how to look, the facts that predict a company's true prospects are usually hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>Financial Fine Print gives you the tools you need to break down annual reports and SEC filings, make sense of the deliberately cryptic language of footnotes, and get the real goods on a potential investment.</p> <p>To make money in today's tough market, investors have to make deliberate, well-researched choices. To do this requires not only having the right information, but also knowing how to decode it. With their obscuring tactics, companies won't help you any. So be advised: those who would help themselves&#x2013;and expect to profit&#x2013;should get down to the nitty-gritty of Financial Fine Print.</p></p><h2>Creating and Implementing Your Strategic Plan: A Workbook for Public and Nonprofit Organizations, 2nd Edition</h2><p><i>Creating and Implementing Your Strategic Plan</i> is the best-selling companion to John Bryson's landmark book, <i>Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations</i>.

Have Armenians, Gypsies, American Indians, or others undergone a comparable genocide? In this fiercely controversial volume, distinguished scholars offer new discussions of this question. Presenting a wide range of strongly held views, they provide no easy consensus.Some critics contend that if the Holocaust is seen as fundamentally different in kind from other genocides or mass deaths, the suffering of other persecuted groups will be diminished. Others argue that denying the uniqueness of the Holocaust will trivialize it. Alan Rosenbaum&#39;s introduction provides a much-needed context for readers to come to terms with this multi-dimensional dispute, to help them understand why it has recently intensified, and to enable them to appreciate what universal lessons might be gleaned from studying the Holocaust.This volume makes an important contribution to our comprehension of one of the defining events of modern history. It should be essential reading for scholars, students, and general readers interested in the Holocaust and its relationship to other instances of politically inspired mass murder.</p><p>This book is a daring compilation of contemporary academic thinking about the Holocaust in a comparative perspective, so that in the process it also concerns, and in some cases also presents, important new information about other cases of genocide.<b>Alan S.

In many Native American tribal societies, it was not uncommon for some men to live as women and some women to live as men. In this land, the original America</p><p>Will Roscoe makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of both Native American culture and alternative gender construction in this extension of the groundbreaking research in <i>The Zuni Man-Woman</i>. More than 150 tribes across America have members who engage in some form of gender identification beyond "male" and "female." Roscoe's study reveals how integral these third and fourth genders, and same-sex marriage, have been to the tribes' societies, in contrast to the intolerance demonstrated by the Judeo-Christian culture of the descendants of European invaders. His analysis of these tribes, rooted in the empirical evidence of their histories, also provides a fascinating counterpoint to theories about homosexual identity rooted solely in modern, Western preconceptions.In many Native American tribal societies, it was not uncommon for some men to live as women and some women to live as men. In this land, the original America, men who wore women&#x2019;s clothes and did women&#x2019;s work became artists, ambassadors, and religious leaders, and women sometimes became warriors, hunters and even chiefs. Same-sex marriages flourished. Berdaches&#x2014;individuals who combine male and female social roles with traits unique to their status as a third gender&#x2014;have been documented in more than 150 North American tribes. By looking at this aspect of non-Western culture, Roscoe challenges the basis of the dualistic way most Americans think about sexuality, and shakes the foundation of the way we understand and define gender.<br></p><h2>Introduction to Astronomy and Cosmology</h2><p><b><i>Introduction to Astronomy &amp; Cosmology</i></b> is a modern undergraduate textbook, combining both the theory behind astronomy with the very latest developments.

Gunther Schuller called Tatum's playing "a marvel of perfection.... His deep-in-the-keys full piano sonority, the tone and touch control in pyrotechnical passages...are miracles of performance." Whitney Balliett wrote "no pianist has ever hit notes more beautifully. Each one--no matter how fast the tempo--was light and complete and resonant, like the letters on a finely printed page." His famous runs have been compared to the arc left against the night sky by a Fourth-of-July sparkler. And to have heard him play, one musician said, "was as awe-inspiring as to have seen the Grand Canyon or Halley's Comet."<br> Now, in <em>Too Marvelous For Words</em>, James Lester provides the first full-length biography of the greatest virtuoso performer in the history of jazz. Before this volume, little was known about Tatum, even among jazz afficionados. What were his origins, who taught him and who provided early pianistic influences, how did he break into the jazz field, what role did he play in the development of other jazz players, and what was he like when he wasn't playing? To answer these questions, Lester has conducted almost a hundred interviews for this book, with surviving family, childhood friends, schoolteachers, and the famous jazz musicians who played with him or knew him. Lester creates a memorable portrait of this unique musician and of the vibrant jazz world of the 1930s and 1940s, capturing the complexity and vitality of this remarkable performer. Tatum, who was virtually blind, suffering between 70% and 90% visual impairment, emerges as cheerful, fun-loving, energetic and out-going, with none of the demonic self-destructiveness that seemed to haunt such jazz greats as Charlie Parker or Billie Holiday. He often joked about his blindness, but did not like it mentioned as a handicap and preferred to pre-plan his entrance to the piano in a club, rather than have someone lead him there. He was simply inexhaustible and had a life-long habit of staying up all night after a gig, usually seeking an after-hours club in which to listen and play until daybreak. Lester also reveals that Tatum was generous with younger players, but his extraordinary technical brilliance often devastated them. No less a talent than Oscar Peterson remembers that after first hearing Tatum, "I gave up the piano for two solid months, and I had crying fits at night." And Les Paul remarked that after hearing Tatum for the first time, he quit piano completely and began playing guitar. Perhaps most important, Lester provides a thorough, knowledgeable discussion of Tatum's music, from his early influences, such as stride pianist Fats Waller, to his mature style in which Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Waller, and Earl Hines all became grist for his harmonic mill.<br> From unexceptional origins in Toledo, Ohio, Art Tatum evolved into a world-class musician whose importance in jazz is comparable to Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker and whose command of the piano captured the admiration of Horowitz and Paderewski. <em>Too Marvelous For Words</em> is the first full portrait of this extraordinary musical genius.<br></p><p><br><strong>James Lester</strong> is a freelance musician, writer, researcher, and photographer in Annapolis, Maryland.<br><br>"In the wonderful continuance of African-American musical expression in the United States, Art Tatum's story is one of the rarest gems of them all....Lester, a former Louisan, has done us all a favor in exposing this great American saga. His book details the joyful journey of a soul lurking in the shadows, awaiting the moment to whip the melody into a frenzy."--<em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em><p></p><br>"Well documented, full of interesting anecdotes, and will give readers valuable insight into the life of this incredible musician."--<em>The Japan Times</em><p></p><br>"Lester carefully separates verifiable information from the abundant fancy about Tatum's relationships and early career; he also excitingly depicts the New York City jazz scene during the rise of be-bop and the enormously rich activity of the 1930s and '40s."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A welcome addition to the canon of jazz biographies."--<em>Quarterly Black Review of Books<p></p></em><br>"An extremely valuable addition to jazz studies."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"The only major biography about jazz pianist Art Tatum, one of the most important keyboardists of the twentieth century....Full of eyewitness accounts of Tatum's superhuman command of the piano by many jazz legends, including Oscar Peterson, Fats Waller Les Paul, and Teddy Wilson....A welcome addition to the canon of jazz biographies."--<em>Quarterly Black Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Besides impressions of Tatum, readers will absorb a sense of the times in which he grew, when the jazz scene was so very different from today's glitzy, academic, and often manicured world....What a relief to finally have it, this readable, personable work."--<em>Toledo Blade</em><p></p><br>"Lester is perceptive and original....Among the spate of jazz biographies that have been inflicted upon us in recent years, <em>Too Marvelous for Words</em> stands out from the crowd. Just like Art Tatum."--<em>The Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Lester has wrtten not only a detailed study of his subject's career and musical influence but a vivid portrayal of the American jazz ferment of the 1930s and '40s....Well-organized and written with clarity, sensitivity and humor."--<em>The Baltimore Sun</em><p></p><br>"<em>Too Marvelous for Words</em> is an important work. It is a much-needed reminder of what a Mount Everest Tatum was, is and always will be on the jazz scene."--<em>The Hartford Courant</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Discourse</h2><p><b>The <i>SAGE Handbook of Organizational Discourse</i> has received the 2004 Outstanding Book Award from the Organizational Communication Division of the National Communication Association<p></p> </b><p><b></b></p> <p>`Organizational discourse is not a new topic but is one that has grown in significance and citations in recent years.

It situates modern French history in transnational and global contexts and also integrates the themes of imperialism and immigration into the traditional narrative.<br><br>Authors Alice L. Conklin, Sarah Fishman, and Robert Zaretsky begin with the premise that while France and the U.S. are sister republics, they also exhibit profound differences that are as compelling as their apparent similarities. The authors frame the book around the contested emergence of the French Republic--a form of government that finally appears to have a permanent status in France--but whose birth pangs were much more protracted than those of the American Republic. Presenting a lively and coherent narrative of the major developments in France's tumultuous history since 1870, the authors organize the chapters around the country's many turning points and confrontations. They also offer detailed analyses of politics, society, and culture, considering the diverse viewpoints of men and women from every background including the working class and the bourgeoisie, immigrants, Catholics, Jews and Muslims, Bretons and Algerians, rebellious youth, and gays and lesbians.</p><p>Robert Zaretsky is Professor of French in the Honors College and Department of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Houston.

But a few do stick, and this book is such a one. <i>Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process</i> broke fresh ground in the understanding of strategy at a time when thinking about strategy was still in its early days, and it has not been displaced since.� <br><br> David J. Hickson, Emeritus Professor of International Management &amp; Organization, University of Bradford School of Management<br><br>Originally published in 1978, <i>Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process</i> became an instant classic, as it bridged the formerly separate fields of strategic management and organizational behavior. In this Stanford Business Classics reissue, noted strategy scholar Donald Hambrick provides a new introduction that describes the book� s contribution to the field of organization studies. Miles and Snow also contribute new introductory material to update the book� s central concepts and themes.<br><br><i>Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process</i> focuses on how organizations adapt to their environments. The book introduced a theoretical framework composed of a dynamic <i>adaptive cycle</i> and an empirically based <i>strategy typology</i> showing four different types of adaptation. This framework helped to define subsequent research by other scholars on important topics such as configurational analysis, organizational fit, strategic human resource management, and multi-firm network organizations.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Miles and Snow&#x2019;s path-breaking work seems as fresh and original today as when it was originally published. Their pioneering efforts at linking strategy, structure, process, and a management mindset is a model for today&#x2019;s researchers who seek to be both academically respectable yet managerially relevant. This book belongs in the core collection of any manager or serious student of strategy organization or management.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christopher Bartlett, Thomas D. Casserly Professor of Business<br>Administration, Harvard Business School<br>&#x201c;I grew up with Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process as the primary intellectual framework for understanding business-level strategy. Now, twenty-five years later, this book remains as relevant and insightful as when it was written.

The purpose of the chronometer is reviewed largely as a navigational aid for ocean-going vessels, but also for survey, medical, and other activities calling for precise time measurement. Representative examples of chronometers and deck watches by international makers&#x2014;from the earliest known to contemporary instruments&#x2014;are illustrated in both color and black and white.

This nostalgic look back at what was essentially a rolling hotel company contracted by the nation&#39;s railroads to provide guest accommodations, covers every aspect of Pullman operations, from the emerging popularity of steam-powered rail travel in the early twentieth century to its diesel-powered zenith and its eventual nadir in the 1950s and 1960s. Pullman&#39;s entire complex network of employees and services is featured, from the ticket offices that manually handled millions of reservations each year to the six car shops spread across the nation to perform heavy maintenance and repairs, and all of Pullman&#39;s porters, mechanics, cleaners, electricians, cooks, barbers, shoeshiners, and more.

Filled with accurate line drawings to aid in identifying crabs, mussels, clams and numerous other shellfish, the book also abounds in recipes and cooking tips all the way from varieties of bouillabaisse, chowders and clambakes to simple Epicurean treats such as boiled periwinkles dipped in melted butter.This foraging and cooking classic was first published in 1964 and has continued to be one of America&#39;s most appreciated works on the subject of seafood. As a young man, Euell Gibbons kept his family alive during the Dust-Bowl era by gathering wild foods. In later years he foraged for seafood all over the coastlines of North America and even Hawaii.

He then explores the evidence for two theories of human dispersal. The "Noah's Ark" school finds a single origin in sub-Saharan Africa for Homo sapiens sapiens, who subsequently colonized the other continents, while the "Candelabra" school argues that Homo erectus evolved independently into Homo sapiens in Asia and possibly Europe. Some of this material appears in Michael E. Brown's The Search for Eve ( LJ 2/1/90), but Fagan's book is far more concise, authoritative, and articulate.

The marriage was not to be a happy one. Liselotte (known in France as Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchesse d'Orl�ans, or "Madame") was full of intellectual energy and moral rigor. Homesick for her native Germany, she felt temperamentally ill-suited to life at the French court. The homosexual Monsieur, deeply immersed in the pleasures and intrigues of the court, shared few of his wife's interests. Yet, for the next fifty years, Liselotte remained in France, never far from the center of one of the most glorious courts of Europe. And throughout this period, she wrote letters -- sometimes as many as forty week -- to her friends and relatives in Germany. It is from this extraordinary body of correspondence that A Woman's Life in the Court of the Sun King has been fashioned. As introduced and translated by Elborg Forster, the letters have become the remarkable personal narrative of Liselotte's transformation from an innocent, yet outspoken, girl into a formidable observer of great events and human folly.</p></p><p><p>The extraordinary correspondence of the sister-in-law of Louis XIV -- the personal narrative of Liselotte's transformation from an innocent, yet outspoken, girl into a formidable observer of great events and human folly.</p><p>Elborg Forster has translated numerous historical studies from French and German, including Selections from the Annales, also available from Johns Hopkins.</p></p><h2>The Advanced Anarchist Arsenal</h2><p>From EOD specialist David Harber comes a bumper crop of new and unusual incendiary and explosive concoctions.

Instructed by an angel to follow the star, four shepherds make their way toward Bethlehem and stop to ask others to join them. Each person they meet has also seen a vision, but the angel has told the man at the well, the fisherman, the plowman, and the couple in the vineyard to carry on their work by the star's light because the Christ child will need their water, fish, bread, and wine some day.

There is increasing evidence, however, that EMFs affect our well-being and are responsible for increased incidences of cancer, miscarriages, and birth defects, as well as diseases of the central nervous and immune systems. As EMFs are a common occurrence in daily life (e.g., household appliances, computer terminals, power transmission lines), it is important to know the hazards, consequences, and preventive measures involved. Sugarman's book is an excellent nontechnical introduction with chapters covering background; EMFs in the community, home, and work; and appendixes of major studies, job exposure risks, safety ratings for appliances, and resources. More accessible than Paul Brodeur's Currents of Death ( LJ 10/1/89) or Robert O. Becker's Cross Currents ( LJ 12/89), this proactive guide is not to be missed.<br><i>- Kathleen L.

When the pastors of the typically-sized church attend church growth and leadership conferences, they can easily come away discouraged, disillusioned, and finding little help to impact their ministries. Glenn Daman is an experienced small church pastor and ministry director who knows that effectiveness is not determined by numbers, programs, and buildings. Instead it is defined by faithful service that results in transformed lives-one person at a time. He offers several keys to effective church ministry-no matter the number of members-including: &#34; Understanding the cultures of the community and the church &#34; Developing a theological foundation &#34; Learning to love God and love others &#34; Developing a mission of reaching, teaching, and recruiting &#34; Uniting the Body through vision Designed for pastors and lay leadership to work through together, Shepherding the Small Church includes chapter-by-chapter suggestions for implementation as well as several appendices of helpful assessment tools. It is an indispensable source of advice and encouragement for the pastor of the majority of American churches. Glenn Daman (D.Min., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; M.A. in New Testament Studies and M.A. in Old Testament Studies, Western Seminary) serves as Director for Small Church Health, Western Seminary. He also ministers as senior pastor of Cascade Locks Community Church in Cascade Locks, Oregon, and First Baptist Church in Stevenson, Washington.Glenn C.

Even as Michael Cunningham brings his literary idol back to life, he intertwines her story with those of two more contemporary women. One gray suburban London morning in 1923, Woolf awakens from a dream that will soon lead to <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>. In the present, on a beautiful June day in Greenwich Village, 52-year-old Clarissa Vaughan is planning a party for her oldest love, a poet dying of AIDS. And in Los Angeles in 1949, Laura Brown, pregnant and unsettled, does her best to prepare for her husband's birthday, but can't seem to stop reading Woolf. These women's lives are linked both by the 1925 novel and by the few precious moments of possibility each keeps returning to. Clarissa is to eventually realize: <blockquote> There's just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seem, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we've ever imagined.... Still, we cherish the city, the morning; we hope, more than anything, for more. </blockquote> As Cunningham moves between the three women, his transitions are seamless. One early chapter ends with Woolf picking up her pen and composing her first sentence, "Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself." The next begins with Laura rejoicing over that line and the fictional universe she is about to enter. Clarissa's day, on the other hand, is a mirror of Mrs. Dalloway's--with, however, an appropriate degree of modern beveling as Cunningham updates and elaborates his source of inspiration. Clarissa knows that her desire to give her friend the perfect party may seem trivial to many. Yet it seems better to her than shutting down in the face of disaster and despair. Like its literary inspiration, <i>The Hours</i> is a hymn to consciousness and the beauties and losses it perceives. It is also a reminder that, as Cunningham again and again makes us realize, art belongs to far more than just "the world of objects." <i>--Kerry Fried</i>4 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Nature's Fury: The Illustrated History of Wild Weather &amp; Natural Disasters</h2><p>Provides a close-up look at some of the world&#39;s most devastating natural disasters, both at the time of the catastrophe and the present day, and examines the science underlying such disasters as the Indian Ocean Tsunami, hurricane Katrina, and other earthquakes, eruptions, tornadoes, and hurricanes.</p><p></p><h2>Civil War: Peter Parker, Spider-man</h2><p>Whose side are you on?

The script is illustrated with over seventy shots and sequences chosen and arranged by film maker Robert Hughes. <br> No film of recent years has aroused more enthusiasm or received more unanimous accolades than Hiroshima Mon Amour. One critic has called it "a thousand films in one," and another says it "has raised the cinema to the level of the arts which authentically represent the movement of thought and the world of perception in the twentieth century." Awarded the International Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, and the N.Y. Film Critics Award for the best foreign film of 1960, this nuanced and finely wrought work of art has since been shown throughout the world and has been variously described as a Proustian creation of remembrance, a poetic love story, an anti-war picture, and the most authentic screen portrait to date of man's inhumanity to man. On the surface the story of a short but profoundly moving love affair between a Japanese architect and a French actress visiting Japan to made a film on peace.. it also recreates compellingly those experiences of war-France under the German occupation, and the Hiroshima bombing which fifteen years later still influence, perhaps even dictate, the lives of both characters.</p><p></p><h2>No Mother to Guide Her</h2><p>Elmer Bliss, nave and implacably optimistic champion of the Southern Californian way, uses his newspaper column to defend the movie world&#39;s indiscretions from the scandal sheets. As Tinseltown parties end in murder, Elmer innocently runs sunny accounts of the stars&#39; wholesome lives. His crowning moment comes as Miss Viola Lake, Hollywood&#39;s favorite clean-cut starlet, is about to be accused of drug abuse and sexual promiscuity during a murder trial that threatens to blow the lid off the film colony. With his good intentions at the ready, Elmer leaps, like a matinee idol, to Viola&#39;s protection. With intimate ease, Anita Loos sets up a fondly sardonic and devastatingly funny tour of the glorious artifice and excess that is Hollywood: tasteless fashions, bizarre religious sects, mass murder, sex, divorce, extravagant morals, industry nepotism, and vacuous inhabitants-fresh from the Midwest-wandering the boulevards in search of fame and fortune.</p><p></p><h2>Bloodborne The Old Hunters Collector&#39;s Edition Guide</h2><p><b>COMPLETE YOUR BLOODBORNE EXPERIENCE</b><br><br>With the release of The Old Hunters, Bloodborne becomes complete.

A memorable performance in its own right, <i>American Humor</i> crackles with the jibes and jokes of generations while presenting a striking picture of a vagabond nation in perpetual self-pursuit. Davy Crockett and Henry James, Jim Crow and Emily Dickinson rub shoulders in a work that inspired such later critics as Pauline Kael and Lester Bangs and which still has much to say about the America of Bob Dylan and Thomas Pynchon, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.</p><p>Constance Rourke (1885-1941) was a historian, anthropologist, and critic who revolutionized the study of American culture. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, and educated at Vassar and the Sorbonne, she spent most of her life in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her influential studies of American life include Trumpets of Jubilee (1927), Troupers of the Gold Coast (1928), and biographies of Davy Crockett (1928), Audubon (1936), and Charles Sheeler: Artist in the American Tradition (1938). Her most famous work remains American Humor: A Study of the National Character, recognized as a classic from its publication in 1931. Rourke devoted her later life to &#x201c;living research,&#x201d; exploring regional culture, from Shaker furniture to African-American song, and Western folk tales. She died in 1941, after falling on an icy porch."The most original piece of investigation and interpretation that has appeared in American cultural history. It is in every way a brilliant book." &#x2014; Lewis Mumford</p><h2>Gibraltar: The Greatest Siege in British History</h2><p><b>A rip-roaring account of the dramatic four-year siege of Britain&#x2019;s Mediterranean garrison by Spain and France&#x2014;an overlooked key to the British loss in the American Revolution</b><br><br>For more than three and a half years, from 1779 to 1783, the tiny territory of Gibraltar was besieged and blockaded, on land and at sea, by the overwhelming forces of Spain and France. It became the longest siege in British history, and the obsession with saving Gibraltar was blamed for the loss of the American colonies in the War of Independence.<br><br>Located between the Mediterranean and Atlantic, on the very edge of Europe, Gibraltar was a place of varied nationalities, languages, religions, and social classes. During the siege, thousands of soldiers, civilians, and their families withstood terrifying bombardments, starvation, and disease. Very ordinary people lived through extraordinary events, from shipwrecks and naval battles to an attempted invasion of England and a daring sortie out of Gibraltar into Spain. Deadly innovations included red-hot shot, shrapnel shells, and a barrage from immense floating batteries.<br><br>This is military and social history at its best, a story of soldiers, sailors, and civilians, with royalty and rank and file, workmen and engineers, priests, prisoners of war, spies, and surgeons, all caught up in a struggle for a fortress located on little more than two square miles of awe-inspiring rock. <i>Gibraltar: The Greatest Siege in British History</i> is an epic page-turner, rich in dramatic human detail<b>&#x2014;</b>a tale of courage, endurance, intrigue, desperation, greed, and humanity. The everyday experiences of all those involved are brought vividly to life with eyewitness accounts and expert research.</p><p>Roy and Lesley Adkins are husband-and-wife historians and archaeologists and the bestselling authors of <i>Gibraltar</i>,<i> Jane Austen&#x2019;s England</i>, <i>Nelson&#x2019;s Trafalgar</i>, <i>Jack Tar</i>, and <i>The Keys of Egypt</i>, among other books.

This strange rocky peninsula fortress, protruding from the southern shore of Andalusia and dominating the landscape, had proved a constant source of irritation ever since its capture by the British in 1704. The Spanish king and his government insisted on regarding Gibraltar as a plundered possession that had to be reclaimed, but the inhabitants of Andalusia were more relaxed, content to enjoy plentiful tradeand friendly relations with their neighbours. So there was nothing unusual about the morning of Saturday 19 June 1779, when the British governor of Gibraltar, Lieutenant-General George Augustus Eliott, rode across the border into Spain at the head of a splendid procession of officers and aides-de-camp. Their destination was the hilltop town of San Roque, 5 miles away, where they intended to congratulate Joaquin de Mendoza, the Spanish governor,on his recent promotion to lieutenant-general.<br><br>Reciprocal social events between the people of Spain and Gibraltar were frequent, and the normal courtesies were dutifully observed, as had happened only two weeks earlier when the British and Spaniards celebrated the birthday of King George III at a gala ball &#x2013; though with hindsight it was perhaps odd that Mendoza&#x2019;s wife attended the event when he himself was absent. Life was exceptionally pleasant for those posted to the military garrison of Gibraltar, and several officers had sent their families to spend the summer at San Roque and in the small Andalusian villages around the picturesque Bay of Gibraltar. They themselves could indulge in fishing or perhaps go on hunting trips further inland, and according to John Drinkwater, an ensign in the 72nd Regiment,<br><br>the strictest intimacy subsisted between the military, and the Spaniards resident in the adjacent villages. Parties were reciprocally visiting each other, and the officers constantly making excursions into the country. These excursions, with others tothe coast of Barbary [Morocco], (which in the season superaboundswith various species of game) were pleasing relaxations from the duties of the garrison, and rendered Gibraltar as eligible a station as any to which a soldier could be ordered.<br><br>Private letters often mentioned local wine being shipped to England, and only a few weeks earlier, on 12 April, Eliott hadwritten to his brother-in-law Sir Francis Drake (a descendant ofthe famous Elizabethan seafarer) that a shipment of wine was onits way to him at Nutwell Court near Exeter in Devon. No payment was required, Eliott said, only Devon cider in return, and he urged Sir Francis to join him at Gibraltar: &#x2018;I am sure it would delight you; travelling in Spain is full as commodious as in Wales. I don&#x2019;t despair of seeing you when the war [with France] is over. The French I should think have nearly enough.&#x2019; Eliott&#x2019;s assessment was wrong, because on the very day he wrote this letter, France and Spain signed a treaty that would change the lives of everyone on Gibraltar.<br><br>When Eliott and his officers reached San Roque, instead oftheir normal welcome, Governor Mendoza was noticeably embarrassed, and their visit was awkward and brief. Something was obviously wrong. Later on that day, back in Gibraltar, the reason for his manner became startlingly clear when Charles Logie, the British consul at Tangier, sailed across the Straits to bring Eliott the news that war between Britain and Spain looked highly likely. Such a war had long been the subject of speculation, and just forty-eight hours later Mendoza wrote officially to Eliott that he had received orders from Madrid to cut off all contact with Gibraltar by land and sea. Every British subject living at San Roque, he said, should return immediately to Gibraltar, even some young girls sick with smallpox, while British residents further afield were instructed to travel to Portugal.<br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Ross and Captain John Vignoles, both of the 39th Regiment, were on leave in Spain and found themselves unable to return. From Malaga, they rode to San Roque, but on being refused entry were forced to make a long journey to the port of Faro in Portugal. They only reached Gibraltar a month later, after rowing back in disguise in an open boat. Others failed in their escape attempts and were taken prisoner. Britain and Spain were now at war, and with cool diplomatic courtesy, Gibraltar was cut off from the world. The Great Siege had begun.<br><br>Already one of the most bitterly contested territories on earth, this was Gibraltar&#x2019;s fourteenth siege. Siege warfare was the processof capturing a fortified place, such as a castle, city or fortress, usually by setting up a blockade to stop supplies getting in, which meant deploying a sizeable army. Especially in the ancient world and during medieval times, before the invention of gunpowder, sieges were commonplace and could drag on for years. The aim was to wear down the defenders so that starvation, thirst and disease would force them to surrender. The besiegers would also attack the defensive walls to weaken and breach them, perhaps using battering rams or weapons such as catapults that fired huge stones. One such siege took place at Harlech Castle.<br><br>Following his conquest of Wales in 1283, the English King Edward I built the castle right on the coast (though it is landlocked now). From 1460, during the Wars of the Roses, it was held by the Lancastrians against the Yorkists and became a base for operations. Edward IV chose not to attack Harlech as it was too costly, but finally decided to capture the castle when Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Pembroke, landed near Harlech in June 1468 and led raids into Wales. A large army was mobilised, and after a siege lasting a few weeks, the garrison surrendered. Claims are made that Harlech was the longest siege in British history, but the siege itself lasted only a very short time. The longest siege was the Great Siege of Gibraltar, lasting 1323 days, from 21 June 1779 to 2 February 1783 and far exceeding the duration of other notable sieges such as Leningrad and Malta in World War Two.<br><br>Although known as the Great Siege, this fourteenth siege of Gibraltar is arguably the greatest ever siege, with its extraordinary events, innovations and massive artillery bombardments exchanged between the British and Spaniards. When it started in 1779, Spain was unable to spare large numbers of troops to capture Gibraltar, and in any case previous sieges had shown the futility of relying on infantry and cavalry attacks. Instead, the plan was to prevent all provisions reaching Gibraltar. It was relatively straightforward to stop communication by land, and Spanish warships would try to prevent vessels sailing to and from the Rock. While the garrison was being starved into submission, France and Spain also planned to invade Britain in order to force everyone to the negotiating table.<br><br>The strategic importance of Gibraltar was well known from Classical times, when it was regarded as one of the Pillars of Hercules, an awe-inspiring sight that warned sailors they hadreached the edge of civilisation. Beyond was the perilous &#x2018;Ocean&#x2019;, thought to be a vast river that encircled the earth. Gibraltar (&#x2018;Calpe&#x2019;) was one of the pillars that the god Hercules had set up,and the other one was Ceuta (&#x2018;Abyla&#x2019;), a similar-shaped rock on the opposite African coast. Originating with the ancient Greeks, the myth of the pillars was subsequently adopted by the Romans.<br><br>It explained how Hercules had cut a channel &#x2013; the Straits &#x2013; to separate Africa and Europe, though another version said that he actually pulled the two continents together to prevent Atlantic sea monsters from bursting into the Mediterranean. With the limitations of their sailing vessels, only the most intrepid sailors would have ventured westwards into the Ocean. The rest would have been deterred by fears of the unknown and the real dangers of difficult tides, currents and winds at the meeting point of the Mediterranean and Atlantic.<br><br>In the fifth century AD, Roman Spain fell to Visigothic invaders. Three centuries later the daughter of Count Julian, the governor of Ceuta, was raped by the Visigothic King Roderick, provoking Julian to persuade the Moors &#x2013; the Muslim inhabitants of Morocco and Algeria &#x2013; to invade Spain. At least, that is how legend explained why, in 711, an invasion and conquest of Spain by Muslim Arabs began when Tarik ibn Ziyad sailed with his army from Tangier, some 30 miles west of Ceuta. He landed near (or possibly on) Gibraltar, a name that derives from the Arabic Djabal Tarik &#x2013; Tarik&#x2019;s Mountain.<br><br>The subsequent Christian &#x2018;Reconquest&#x2019; (Reconquista) to recover the lost lands across the Iberian peninsula lasted nearly eight centuries, and during this struggle Ferdinand IV of Castile took control of Gibraltar in 1309 after its very first siege. It was a brief Christian interlude, because during a fourth siege twenty-four years later, the fortress reverted to Muslim control. On the other side of the Straits, Ceuta was captured from the Moors in 1415 by Portugal, which was that country&#x2019;s first overseas conquest. Gibraltar itself did not again surrender to Christian control until the eighth siege, on 20 August 1462 &#x2013; the feast day of St Bernard of Clairvaux, who became Gibraltar&#x2019;s patron saint. This ended seven centuries of Muslim rule, and although further sieges followed, they were between warring Christian factions.<br><br>Ferdinand II of Aragon and his cousin Isabella of Castile were married in 1469, and their joint rule as the &#x2018;Catholic Monarchs&#x2019; led to the unification of Spain as a single nation. Granada was the last Muslim kingdom to surrender, in January 1492, marking the&nbsp;end of the Reconquest, and Ferdinand and Isabella then gave their blessing for Christopher Columbus to embark on his voyage of exploration across the Atlantic &#x2013; well beyond the Pillars of Hercules. That same year also saw religious persecution escalate across Spain, with the expulsion of thousands of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, followed shortly afterwards by Muslims being given the same choice of conversion or expulsion.<br><br>By now, the Duke of Medina Sidonia held Gibraltar, but he complied with an order from Isabella to surrender it to the Spanish Crown, and in July 1502 a new coat-of-arms was granted to Gibraltar that included a castle linked by a chain to a key. The accompanying Royal Warrant explained that Gibraltar &#x2018;is very strong and, by virtue of its position, is the key to those kingdoms between the eastern and western seas, and the guardian and defender of the Straits between these same seas, such that no ships or people passing from one sea to the other can fail to see it or call in&#x2019;. Isabella died two years later, and her last will and testament decreed: &#x2018;I charge the Princess [her daughter Joanna] and the Prince, her husband [Philip of Burgundy], and the Kings who shall succeed me in these Realms, ever to hold as inalienably of the Crown and Royal Patrimony, the City of Gibraltar and all that belongs to it; never to give it away, or alienate it or suffer it to begiven away or alienated, nor anything that belongs to it.&#x2019; Contrary to her will, Gibraltar was lost two centuries later, but before then Spain gained Ceuta when, in 1580, Philip II of Spain also became Portugal&#x2019;s king. Ceuta has remained in Spanish hands ever since,even after Portugal became independent.<br><br>With an improvement in sailing ships, the seventeenth century saw power shift from the central Mediterranean to countries on Europe&#x2019;s western seaboard, notably Britain, Spain, Portugal and Holland. In the middle of the century, England decided to keep a permanent naval squadron in the Mediterranean, though Oliver Cromwell thought a few frigates would be sufficient if Gibraltar was taken. Without a suitable invasion force, nothing came of this plan, but after the restoration of the monarchy Charles II obtained Tangier in 1662 as part of the dowry of his&nbsp;wife, Catherine of Braganza, daughter of the king of Portugal. Avast amount was spent on a mole to create a sheltered harbour, but Tangier was deemed too costly to maintain, especially after being constantly attacked and besieged by the Moors under their ruler Muley Ismail. Samuel Pepys was brought from London to advise on Tangier&#x2019;s destruction, which was then reduced to rubble and abandoned. The Moors partly rebuilt Tangier, and from 1694 thousands of Muley Ismail&#x2019;s troops turned their attention to taking Spanish-held Ceuta.<br><br>When Carlos II of Spain died childless in November 1700, Philip, Duke of Anjou, succeeded to the throne as Philip V of Spain. Because he was the grandson of Louis XIV of France, the Sun King, it was feared that France would dominate worldwide trade, and so the War of Spanish Succession was triggered, with Britain, Austria and the Netherlands supporting the rival Habsburgclaimant &#x2013; the Archduke Charles of Austria. On the Continent, the Duke of Marlborough commanded Anglo-Dutch forces against the French, with notable victories at Blenheim and Ramillies, while Admiral Sir George Rooke was in charge of an Anglo-Dutchfleet. A naval base was urgently needed between the French and Spanish Atlantic and Mediterranean ports, and so in 1703 Rooke was ordered to seize the Spanish port of Cadiz. He failed in the attempt, but shortly afterwards Portugal signed the Methuen Treaty with England, and the allied fleet was able to make use of Lisbon instead.<br><br>The following year, Rooke attempted to take Barcelona, but the attack was soon called off. At a council of war on board his flagship,it was decided &#x2013; almost as an afterthought &#x2013; to attack Gibraltar. Manned by a weak Spanish garrison, the Rock was captured withrelative ease in the name of Archduke Charles on 24 July 1704 (according to the calendar still used in England; it was 4 August elsewhere in Europe). Just three months later, the Spaniards tried to regain Gibraltar in what was its twelfth siege, but gave up in April 1705. The War of Spanish Succession dragged on with enormous costs to both sides, but peace negotiations finally began in1712, and the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in March 1713.<br><br>Part of the settlement confirmed Philip V as king of Spain, so the intended purpose of the war had failed, though Great Britain (Scotland and England having formally established a union in1709) did gain Gibraltar, which was granted in perpetuity, along with the Mediterranean island of Minorca that had been captured from Spain in 1708. The treaty did not deter Spain from mounting yet another siege of Gibraltar in 1727, the thirteenth, but theattempt was abandoned four months later. The Spaniards fared better at Ceuta, because on the death of Muley Ismail in the same year, the siege that had lasted intermittently for so long was finally lifted.<br><br>At the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x2019; War in 1756, rumours were heard that Minorca was under threat, and so in early April Vice-Admiral John Byng&#x2019;s squadron was ordered t...</p><h2>Conservatism in America since 1930: A Reader</h2><p><p>While there have long been libertarians, agrarians, individualists, collectivists, nationalists, and others who fit the contemporary label of &#x201c;conservative,&#x201d; no cohesive conservative movement existed prior to World War II.

He regarded Lucy with a lot of interest infused with a dash of cool disapproval. She found the combination both annoying and unnerving. But the real problem was that Mason looked even better now than he had thirteen years ago when he had figured so powerfully in her fevered teenage imagination. Her first reaction upon walking through the door of Fletcher Hardware had been primal and flat-out breath�taking. I&#x2019;ve been looking for you. The wolf-sized dog that padded out from behind the counter to inspect her regarded her with an expression remarkably similar to Ma�son&#x2019;s. The animal wasn&#x2019;t just the size of a wolf&#x2014;it looked like one, as well. An aging wolf, she concluded. There was some gray around the muzzle. The beast&#x2019;s eyes were not the standard dark brown associated with most breeds. Instead, they were a disconcerting shade of hazel gold that was a little too close to the color of Mason&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Joe,&#x201d; Mason said, nodding toward the dog. She looked down at Joe and held out her hand. &#x201c;Hello, Joe.&#x201d; </p><p>Joe stared at her for a moment longer, his gaze unflinching. Evi�dently concluding that she was neither a threat nor prey, he sniffed her fingers. Satisfied, he sat back. Gingerly, she scratched him behind his ears. Joe chuffed a bit and licked her hand. </p><p>&#x201c;He likes you,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;Mostly he ignores people.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thrilled, of course, that he doesn&#x2019;t intend to rip out my throat,&#x201d; Lucy said. </p><p>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t gone for anyone&#x2019;s throat for at least a week.&#x201d; Mason tossed the gleaming wrench into the air and caught it with a barely noticeable twist of his wrist, making it look easy. &#x201c;Heard you were in town to clean out your aunt&#x2019;s place and put it on the market.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan.&#x201d; She stopped rubbing Joe&#x2019;s ears and straightened. </p><p>She was determined to remain as cool as Mason. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. She was still struggling to get past the shock of coming face-to-face with him. She had expected to see his uncle behind the counter when she walked into the hardware store. </p><p>The possibility that she might run into Mason while she was in Summer River had occurred to her, but she had dismissed it as ex�tremely remote. According to the last update from Sara some six months ago, Mason was in Washington, D.C., where he and his brother ran a very expensive, very low-profile, very sophisticated pri�vate security consulting business. </p><p>&#x201c;How long will you be around?&#x201d; Mason asked. </p><p>She smiled. She couldn&#x2019;t help it. She made a show of glancing at her watch. &#x201c;Less than three minutes into this conversation and already it sounds like an interrogation. In hindsight I may have made a mistake when I advised you to go into law enforcement all those years ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You made the suggestion. I&#x2019;m the one who made the decision.&#x201d; </p><p>What in the world was that supposed to mean? she wondered. Sud�denly she got that faint, tiny little inner ping of knowing, the same sensation she experienced when she was closing in on a missing heir. Something bad had happened to Mason Fletcher. She would have bet good money that it was linked to his career path. And, being Mason Fletcher, he was taking full responsibility for the decision that had sent him down that road. Mason hadn&#x2019;t changed, she thought. He was the kind of man who would always take full responsibility&#x2014;even for stuff that, technically speaking, wasn&#x2019;t his responsibility. </p><p>She sought a neutral topic of conversation. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to see that the hardware store survived,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When did your uncle buy it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A few months after he retired.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the last store on the block that was here when I used to visit Aunt Sara. This town has really changed.&#x201d; </p><p>Most of the old, traditional stores on Main Street had been replaced with upscale shops and trendy eateries. Fletcher Hardware&#x2014;bordered on one side by a wine shop and on the other side by an art gallery&#x2014; was a stubborn anachronism. </p><p>Mason surprised her with a wry smile. &#x201c;Welcome to the new, im�proved wine-country boutique town of Summer River. But in case you&#x2019;re wondering, the old Summer River is still here, just beneath the surface.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Meaning it&#x2019;s still a small town. News travels fast.&#x201d; </p><p>Lucy nodded. &#x201c;Which is how you knew that I was here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A lot of people know you&#x2019;re here, Lucy,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>She raised her brows in polite inquiry. &#x201c;Is that a warning?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. The fact that you are Sara&#x2019;s sole heir has stirred up some deep waters.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d; </p><p>She had been ignoring phone calls from lawyers and realtors for more than a month while she considered how to deal with her in�heritance. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I asked you how long you plan to stay,&#x201d; Mason said. </p><p>&#x201c;The answer to your question is that I don&#x2019;t know how long I&#x2019;ll be in town.&#x201d; She was determined not to let him intimidate her. &#x201c;A couple of weeks, I think. I need to make arrangements to pack and move my aunt&#x2019;s belongings, and then I have to get the house ready to put on the market.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The place should sell fast,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a real nice little ex�ample of the Craftsman style, and one thing that has come out of Summer River going upscale is that property values have skyrocketed. Folks looking for a weekend house in wine country love that kind of architecture. But the real value is in the property.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The old orchard?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s prime vineyard land. Worth a bundle in this market. Every new Silicon Valley billionaire wants to open his very own winery and put his name on a label. It&#x2019;s a major status symbol.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I noticed that most of the orchards and farms are gone.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been disappearing for years. I&#x2019;m surprised you didn&#x2019;t know that. But then, you never came back to visit Sara after you left thirteen years ago, did you?&#x201d; </p><p>The comment, freighted as it was with stern disapproval, hit her like a bucket of cold water. Anger flashed through her. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, that answers one question,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I knew the town had changed, but when I walked in here I won�dered if you had changed. Clearly the answer is no. You are still in the habit of jumping to conclusions, assuming the worst and giving lectures.&#x201d; </p><p>He thought about that for a moment and then inclined his head half an inch. &#x201c;You know what? You&#x2019;re right. Maybe I did jump to con�clusions. So why didn&#x2019;t you come to visit your aunt for the past thir�teen years?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What makes you so sure I haven&#x2019;t been back here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Deke mentioned that you never returned.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Your uncle implied that I ignored my aunt all these years?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He just commented that you hadn&#x2019;t come back, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Once again Mason tossed the steel wrench casually into the air and caught it with fluid ease. &#x201c;He said you never returned after that summer when I pissed you off by yanking you out of the party at Harper Ranch Park.&#x201d; </p><p>That stopped her. &#x201c;The old Harper Ranch is now a park?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The town took it over a couple of years ago. Grass, picnic tables, a ball field, playground, dog-walking areas, the works. You wouldn&#x2019;t recognize the place.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I see. Well, as it happens, your uncle is right. This is the first time I&#x2019;ve returned to Summer River since that night.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p><p>She gave him a serene go-to-hell smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really none of your busi�ness, is it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nope, just curious.&#x201d; </p><p>Thirteen years ago everyone said you didn&#x2019;t want to mess with Mason Fletcher. Nothing had changed except that he was now the man she had known that he would become and then some. It was as if he had been tempered in fire like the steel blade of some ancient sword. Everything about him had gotten harder, stronger, more re�lentless. The sharp planes and angles of his face had become fierce. Time had added some sleek, solid muscle and endowed him with the confident air of a man who knows what he wants, what he will toler�ate and where he draws the line. </p><p>The years had given him something else as well&#x2014;the rare, invisible aura of quiet, inner power that was the hallmark of a man in full con�trol of himself. </p><p>He did, however, look considerably the worse for wear around the edges. She had a feeling he&#x2019;d learned the hard way what every profes�sional guardian angel probably had to learn&#x2014;that you couldn&#x2019;t save everyone. For a man as determined and unyielding as Mason, that would have been one very tough lesson. </p><p>In spite of her irritation, she felt herself softening. It was hard to stay mad at a man who was born to do the right thing when the chips were down. He really couldn&#x2019;t help it, she thought. He was what he was, and there was probably no force on the face of the planet that could change that. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for Pete&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just to clarify, Aunt Sara did not want me to come back here after that last summer. In fact, she didn&#x2019;t want anyone in the family to visit her in Summer River. We respected her wishes. And while I certainly don&#x2019;t owe you any explanations, I can assure you that I saw a lot of her. She and Mary stayed with me several times each year. Sara knew that I find the holidays stressful, so she made sure to spend them with me. After she and Mary sold the antiques shop, I joined them on some of their cruises. I can assure you that Sara was not neglected in any way.&#x201d; Lucy took a breath. &#x201c;I loved her. And I loved Mary, too, because she loved Sara and Sara loved her. There. Satisfied?&#x201d; </p><p>Mason had the grace to look apologetic. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to imply you had neglected your aunt.&#x201d; </p><p>She gave him her best fake bright smile. &#x201c;Of course you did.&#x201d; </p><p>His jaw hardened. &#x201c;I understand that family dynamics can be com�plicated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No kidding. Especially when viewed from the outside.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason exhaled slowly. &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;ve made your point. I liked Sara. Mary, too. I was sorry to hear that they had been killed.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Lucy said. She hesitated, wondering if it was too soon to probe for answers. </p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you heard it was a car accident?&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s always a shock. Aaron and I lost our parents in a car accident.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long time,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean it didn&#x2019;t happen and that it didn&#x2019;t leave some major wounds. You heal from wounds, if you&#x2019;re lucky, but there are always scars.&#x201d; </p><p>He looked as if the simple observation had caught him off guard. She got the feeling he was unsure how to respond. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he agreed finally. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean there aren&#x2019;t scars.&#x201d; </p><p>She tightened her grip on the straps of the black tote she had slung over her shoulder. &#x201c;Were you here in town when my aunt and Mary . . . ?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, I arrived a couple of weeks ago. I&#x2019;m taking some time off from work.&#x201d; He eyed her with sudden, sharp curiosity. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Just wondered.&#x201d; She felt a little deflated. If Mason had been in town at the time of the accident, he probably would have asked any questions that needed to be asked. He had been a cop, after all. But he had not been in Summer River when Sara and Mary died. He didn&#x2019;t know any more than she did. &#x201c;Sara told me that you and your brother run a security consulting firm back in D.C.&#x201d; </p><p>He looked first surprised and then amused. &#x201c;Sara kept you in�formed of my whereabouts?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I gather that from time to time your uncle told her what was going on with you and your brother.&#x201d; Lucy smiled. &#x201c;Sara said he is very proud of both of you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Deke and I always knew that Aaron would do something to change the world,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;He wound up with degrees in math and computer science.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Impressive. What, exactly, do you and Aaron do as consultants?&#x201d; </p><p>He gave her what was no doubt meant to be a charming consul�tant&#x2019;s smile. &#x201c;We consult.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I get that. And for the record, the I&#x2019;m-a-consultant-and-I&#x2019;m�here-to-help smile needs an upgrade.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason stopped smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work on it.&#x201d; </p><p>I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Who do you consult for?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We specialize in closing cold cases. Our clients are mostly small-town police departments that lack the expertise, the technology and the manpower to handle major crimes that have gone stone cold.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you go out into the field to investigate?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes. But our primary asset is a proprietary computer pro�gram we named Alice. Aaron created it to help identify patterns in an old case. If we can find a pattern, we&#x2019;ve got a shot at helping the cops track down the perps.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sounds exciting.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a cop anymore, I&#x2019;m a consultant,&#x201d; he said coolly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see much action.&#x201d; </p><p>He probably wasn&#x2019;t lying, she decided. But he wasn&#x2019;t telling her the whole truth, either. </p><p>&#x201c;What can I do for you today?&#x201d; Mason continued. &#x201c;I assume you came in here to pick up some of the things you need to get your aunt&#x2019;s house ready for the market?&#x201d; </p><p>Whoa. Talk about hitting a stone wall, Lucy thought. Mason wanted to change the topic of conversation. </p><p>&#x201c;Actually, I stopped in to get some advice about local contractors from your uncle. I wasn&#x2019;t sure who else to ask. I know Sara trusted Deke when it came to that sort of thing.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I can ask him for some names when he gets back. What kind of work are you thinking of doing?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The big-ticket item is the kitchen. It&#x2019;s badly outdated. Dad says that bringing it up to date will add a few thousand to the value of the house.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;Is your dad still a professor?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. He&#x2019;s head of the sociology department at the college where he teaches.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And your mother?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still teaching psychology.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason put the wrench down on the counter. &#x201c;Both your folks re�married, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, making the word very crisp. &#x201c;About that contractor. I&#x2019;ve got a limited budget.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Mason reached for a pad of paper. He pulled it close and picked up a pen. &#x201c;Okay, you want someone who can update the kitchen without spending a fortune. Anything else? </p><p>&#x201c;The outside needs painting.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s another major job.&#x201d; Mason wrote a note on the pad of paper and then looked up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting to talk big bucks here. I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s worth it, to tell you the truth.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But everyone says those are the sorts of upgrades that add value to the house.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true, but around here, it&#x2019;s the land itself that has the real value. Still, those old Craftsman houses go for a nice chunk of change, and there are always people looking for weekend places. I&#x2019;m just sug�gesting that you don&#x2019;t pour a lot of cash into upgrades.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;There is one project I&#x2019;d like to do inside that I think will make a big cosmetic difference in the living room.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I want to restore the fireplace to its original condition. It really was beautiful.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I remember it,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;There was a lot of nice stonework around it. You don&#x2019;t see good craftsmanship like that anymore.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately, Aunt Sara covered the entire front of the fireplace with tile.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Huh. Wonder why?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. She never mentioned it, so when I walked into the house yesterday I was surprised to see what she had done.

Nigel Pennick investigates the significance of these mysterious pathways and asks if they evolved as an expression of the meaning of life. This is a complete account of ancient rock labyrinths and turf mazes, church labyrinths, puzzle hedge mazes, and modern innovations in Britain and on the Continent.</p><p>Nigel Pennick worked in scientific research for fifteen years in Cambridge, with periods at the Universit� Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium and the University of Guelph, Canada. In this time, he published twenty-nine scientific papers that described eight new species of marine algae. He lost his profession in 1985 when the institute was closed during government spending cuts and so he became a full-time writer and lecturer on history and folklore. In parallel with his scientific work at that time, he participated in folk traditions and the scene in Cambridge. In 1975 he founded the Institute of Geomantic Research, which published a journal and many occasional papers on all aspects of geomancy and earth mysteries. From the mid-1980s to the late &#39;90s, he travelled widely and gave lectures and workshops at venues in Ireland, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the United States as well as in Great Britain. He also organized and participated in several spiritual tours of ancient sacred places in England, Wales and Ireland. During this period, he was also writing books on subjects that include the runes, mythology, geomancy, ley lines, labyrinths, Celtic art and landscapes, traditional rites and ceremonies, folk magic and histories of certain underground railways in London. He is also an artist in traditional media and stained glass and has illustrated many of his books. In 2011 he had a one-man show of his Visionary Steeples artwork at Emmanuel Church, Cambridge. Currently, he plays music with The Traditional Music of Cambridgeshire Collective and throughout the year participates in the traditional calendar customs of Cambridgeshire, in 2009 having restored the custom of parading the May Day Garland through Cambridge.</p><h2>Grantland Issue 3</h2><p><i>Grantland Quarterly</i> is a collaboration between McSweeney's and Bill Simmons's new web magazine Grantland.

Most of them are amusing in their own esoteric sort of way, but few aim for more than entertainment value. David Grambs watches over words gone (or going) by in the same way that the National Wildlife Federation watches over grizzly bears and timber wolves. He would like his readers to think of his <i>Endangered English Dictionary</i> as "a constant reminder of the words that could have been, that fell through the cracks. Or--" he challenges, "if you and enough others make imaginative use of this book--that still could become part of our everyday usage." Toward this goal, Grambs has chosen "common-use, nontechnical words," and he has arranged his book as a two-way dictionary. <p> So if you are looking for a compact way to describe something--a flower, say--that smells strongest at night, try "noctuolucent." If you were a delicate blossom, or even a whole "tuzzymuzzy" (a bunch of flowers), you too might wish to avoid the "sizzard" (unbearably humid heat) of summer days. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>David Grambs has worked as a lexicographer, editor, travel reporter, and translator.

Has she been brainwashed? Coerced? Could she be sincere? Why would such a nice girl disavow her loving parents, her adoring fianc�, her comfortable home? Why would she suddenly adopt the SLA's cri de coeur, "Death to the Fascist Insect that Preys Upon the Life of the People"? Soon most of the SLA are dead, killed in a suicidal confrontation with police in Los Angeles, forcing Tania and her two remaining comrades--the pompous and abusive General Teko and his duplicitous lieutenant, Yolanda--into hiding, where they will remain for the next sixteen months. <br><br><i>Trance</i>, Christopher Sorrentino's mesmerizing and brilliant second novel, traces this fugitive period, leading the reader on a breathtaking, hilarious, and heartbreaking underground tour across a beleaguered America, in the company of scam artists, visionaries, cultists, and a mismatched gang of middle-class people who typify the guiding conceit of their time, that of self-renovation. Along the way he tells the story of a nation divided against itself--parents and children, men and women, black and white; a story of hidebound tradition and radical change, of truth and propaganda, of cynicism and idealism; a story as transfixing and relevant today as it was then.<br><br>Insightful, compassionate, scathingly funny, and moving, <i>Trance</i> is a virtuoso performance, placing Christopher Sorrentino in the first rank of American novelists.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Christopher Sorrentino</b> is the author of a previous novel, <i>Sound on Sound</i>.

He lives in Brooklyn<br><br>Trance is a panoramic, documentary-style novel based on the final months of Patty Hearst's tenure in the Symbionese Liberation Army. Christopher Sorrentino is most interested in capturing the 1970s zeitgeist, and his obsessive narrative eye rambles almost haphazardly after one character, then another, like an extended Robert Altman opening shot that covers 500 pages.<p>It is, at times, a compelling piece of work. Sorrentino is best at capturing the inbred logic of the radical revolutionary cell and their members' instinctual mistrust -- even hatred -- of the individual human heart. For example, here is Sorrentino following a heartbroken Tania (a stand-in for Patty) after she watched on TV as half of the SLA was incinerated in a massive firefight:</p><p>"They killed them. They killed him. They killed her. She crawls on hands and knees to the bathroom, closes the door with her shoulder, and then wedges her upper body in the space between the tub and the toilet, feeling the cool of the porcelain and tile against her skin. . . . She will never see Cujo again [her SLA captor and lover]. They've taken him. She will not know this grief again until she repudiates him in open court. But that is twenty-one months away. . . . Yolanda starts banging on the door.</p><p>" 'Come out here, Tania!' she says peevishly. 'You're not being very respectful of our fallen comrades!' "</p><p>Over hundreds of pages, Tania becomes a symbol of the 1970s (will she or won't she disown the social revolution?). But sadly, no rounded, living, breathing Tania, no literary reincarnation of a flesh-and-blood Patty Hearst emerges in the novel. There's no explanation of how her change from preppy to revolutionary occurred.</p><p>Here we are in Tania's mind while on the run early in the novel:</p><p>"Three nights at the Cosmic Age. Every minute, all thirty-seven hundred of them, meaningless, each a sort of obstacle to be overcome by the habit of being. First you put one foot down. Then you put the other in front of it. . . . Her job is to stay in the room. Just another face in an upstairs window, she parts the drapes to survey the parking lot, the cars rolling in and out. Vacationers, deliberately insulated from the news, arrive wide-eyed, like refugees from the road, the desert's affectless serenity." </p><p>The only fresh snippet here is Tania parting the drapes to look out. All the rest is the author's philosophical voice intoning rather flatly. Did the words "habit of being" or the "desert's affectless serenity" ever really cross this girl's mind?</p><p>Instead of revealing Tania, Trance shadows various players involved tangentially in the final acts of the SLA drama. When the characters are worthy of this extended attention, the novel works, even if you're wondering what Tania and her SLA pals are up to as you head to Manhattan with, say, writer/hustler Guy Mock, who's pitching a book based on his ties to the SLA. (Actually, these pages provide some needed comic relief and cut through the radical inertia that pervades the novel.) </p><p>Strangely, if remaining in the reader's mind is the definition of a well-drawn character, and even though she only has a bit role, Lydia Galton (Tania's mother) steals the show from her daughter toward the end of the book. Here is a scene between Guy Mock, Lydia Galton and Hank Galton (Mr. Hearst):</p><p>"[GUY:] 'More information has come to light.' </p><p>"[LYDIA:] 'And what would you like in exchange for this information?' </p><p>"[HANK:] 'Lydia. Guy freely offered information to us last time.' </p><p>"[LYDIA:] 'Isn't that how pushers work? The first time's always free?'</p><p>"[HANK:] 'Apparently you know more about that than I.' </p><p>"Guy gazes wistfully at the icy dregs in the bottom of his glass.</p><p>"Lydia says, 'Oh, don't pretend to be embarrassed. You don't have to put on a phony display of discomfiture.' "</p><p>Such tightness, such icy interplay, shows Sorrentino's possibilities. But something is wrong if Tania's mother is more interesting than Tania. Amazing facts and compulsive observations hide the reality that the novelist only infrequently connects with his characters' hearts. After half the SLA dies in the shoot-out with police early in this book, Sorrentino takes four full pages in the section titled "Threnody" to address Tania's father directly, giving him a guided tour of the autopsy room with such sentences as: "Would you have guessed, Mr. Galton, that burned corpses possessed so many specific traits . . . ? Were you surprised to learn . . . that even the most badly burned corpses routinely present with organs that are more or less intact? That the fluid level in the organs and body cavities prevents total incineration?" Mr. Galton thinks he has just lost his child; why not use these four pages to explore his affections rather than drag us through the scientific and repellant minutiae of the autopsy room?</p><p>In the end, this is a case of the novelist as a trendy but rather chilly genius, more impressed with his own voice than the humanity of his characters. </p><p>Reviewed by Tom Paine <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Patterns range from a 1920s-style cloche hat revamped for the twenty-first century to a 1970s-style poncho-style wrap, updated for today with a tweed-style stitch. Unlike knitting books that simply copy vintage patterns, Vintage Knitting aims to reinvent retro patterns by adding details that reflect today&#39;s tastes and developments in fashion. Each project uses modern yarns, but encourages knitters to seek out vintage accessories if they can find them, and suggests sources where such items can be obtained. Most of this book&#39;s patterns are for more experienced knitters, but several are easy enough for newcomers to master before they go on to more challenging projects.

Each of the book's chapters is inspired by a different decade from the past century with projects of various skill levels and complexities, ranging from a 1920s flapper-style tasseled top and cloche hat and a 1950s beaded cardigan to a 1960s handbag and 1980s legwarmers. Each project uses modern yarns but draws on key fashion looks from bygone eras and encourages knitters to use vintage accessories and notions. The author gives historical background on each decade's fashion themes, and mood boards feature illustrations, photos, materials, and colorways that inspired the book's projects. <i>Knitting Vintage </i> concludes with a directory on sourcing vintage haberdashery, as well as instruction on the care and handling of home-knitted items. <br> <br> Claire Montgomerie, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in London, is a textile designer who has worked in both the British and U.S. fashion markets.

Are we drinking our morning coffee on a Sunday as we sit down and read our newstablet? Look around any doctor's office waiting room and you will find two people reading the same magazine, one holding the paper version, another on their phone. With so many mediums, designers need to evaluate the best formats to convey an editorial vision. In <i>Designing the Editorial Experience</i>, authors <b>Sue Apfelbaum</b> and <b>Juliette Cezzar</b> will discuss what it means to design for multiple media. It features advice from professionals in both the design and editorial fronts --and digital strategists too-- about what is constant and what is changing in the field. Inside, you will find examples of the best editorial design being produced today. In addition, explore the audiences for content, what forms the content takes, and how workflows are managed.

It&#x2019;s the most important characteristic, after writing style, to establish identity. Choosing distinctive type puts less pressure on writing style, art, and layout to carry out the identity. While choosing type that could be described as &#x201c;quirky&#x201d; would quickly tire your reader, choosing type that is ubiquitous means the reader soon forgets where he is reading an article. In larger formats, such as printed magazines, playfulness with type for titles, headers, and pull quotes can also be a way to establish a unique identity. More reliable, however, is setting and clearly communicating guidelines for proportioning this type. A custom type treatment may not travel to a smaller device, but a simple proportion and spacing can always be kept consistent, regardless of platform.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p>There's never been a more rewarding and challenging time to be designing reading experiences. How we create magazines, newspapers, journals, blogs, and any other periodical, whether print or digital, is as much influenced by time-tested principles as by recent thinking about readers and how they're engaging with content. How do designers respond to the need for a continuous experience across media as technology continues to evolve? What are the opportunities for print in this new landscape where information is everywhere?<br>This series of conversations, case studies, and elementary principles is an essential guide for both advanced design students and editorial designers seeking to broaden their practice.

Uido is ecstatic about becoming her tribe's spiritual leader, but her new position brings her older brother's jealousy and her best friend's mistrust. And looming above these troubles are the recent visits of strangers from the mainland who have little regard for nature or the spirits, and tempt the tribe members with gifts, making them curious about modern life. When Uido's little brother falls deathly ill, she must cross the ocean and seek their help. Having now seen so many new things, will Uido have the strength to believe in herself and the old ways? And will her people trust her to lead them to safety when a catastrophic tsunami threatens? Uido must overcome everyone's doubts, including her own, if she is to keep her people safe and preserve the spirituality that has defined them.<br><br> Drawing on firsthand experience from her travels to the Andaman Islands, Padma Venkatraman was inspired to write this story after meeting natives who survived the 2004 tsunami and have been able to preserve their unique way of life.

One chapter covers the group's evolution from a nomadic life as hunters/gatherers to that of farmers, herders, and weavers. Other chapters discuss their strong spiritual attachment to the land and their intense resistance to Spanish and Anglo settlers. The roles played by prominent American military leaders in the series of broken treaties and encroachments onto Navajo land that eventually led to the Long Walk are covered, as are those of the determined native leaders who eluded capture and survived harsh conditions rather than be led away into captivity and exile. The government's reversal of this policy of imprisonment, the return of the Navajo to their ancestral lands, and their efforts to rebuild their herds and keep their children out of boarding schools are covered in the final chapters. The text is sometimes repetitious. For example, Kit Carson's role in the war against the Navajo and Apache is described in the fifth chapter and in a separate feature about the man. The book is illustrated with informative black-and-white photographs and reproductions.

The wind is blowing the snow in here and it is already cold enough.&#x2019;Brother Eadulf turned from where he had been peering in disgust through the half-open door of the inn, out into the dusk at the whirling snowstorm. He reluctantly pushed the door shut and fastened the wooden latch before facing the small, stocky innkeeper. The man, with balding head and cheeks so red that they seemed polished, was regarding him with some sympathy.&#x2018;Are you absolutely sure that there is no available transport to Aldred&#x2019;s Abbey?&#x2019; Eadulf had asked the question several times before. What was the innkeeper&#x2019;s name? Cynric? Yes, that was it.The innkeeper stood, wiping his hands against the leather apron that covered his corpulent form.&#x2018;As I have already told you, Brother, you and your companion were lucky to have made it this far before the storm started in earnest. If you had missed this tavern, there is no shelter between here and the River Aide.&#x2019;&#x2018;The snow was nowhere near as bad as this when we left the river at Mael&#x2019;s Tun and began to walk here,&#x2019; Eadulf agreed, moving away from the door into the warmer interior of the inn.&#x2018;So you came up to Mael&#x2019;s Tun by the river then?&#x2019; the innkeeper asked with that interest all hosts have in the comings and goings of their guests.&#x2018;Aye. We came by barge from the mouth of the Deben. Only after we had left Mael&#x2019;s Tun did the wind get up and the snow start to fall like a white sheet. It was so dense that you could scarcely see a hand in front of your eyes. By then we were far enough away from the settlement not to contemplate turning back.&#x2019;&#x2018;Well, you were lucky to strike on my little tavern,&#x2019; the innkeeper repeated. &#x2018;The marshlands to the north and east of here are no place to be wandering unless you can see the path before you.&#x2019;&#x2018;But the abbey is no more than four of five miles from here,&#x2019; Brother Eadulf pointed out. &#x2018;We&#x2019;d be there easily enough if we had a horse.&#x2019;<i>&#x2018;If</i> you had a horse,&#x2019; the innkeeper replied with emphasis. &#x2018;I have one mule and that I need, Brother. And you&#x2019;d be very lucky to find the abbey even if you had such an animal to transport you. There is no one else on the roads this evening. Look at the snow outside. It is drifting in the valleys and against the hedgerows. The wind is bitter and from the east. No one in their right minds would attempt to travel these roads on such a night.&#x2019;Brother Eadulf made a clicking sound with his tongue to express his irritation. The innkeeper continued to regard him with sympathy.&#x2018;Why not seat yourself by the fire? Your companion should join you shortly and I will bring you some refreshment,&#x2019; he suggested cheerfully.Brother Eadulf still hesitated.&#x2018;Tomorrow, the storm may abate and the roads to the abbey may be easier to negotiate,&#x2019; the innkeeper added persuasively.&#x2018;I need to be at the abbey this evening because ...&#x2019; Brother Eadulf hesitated and then shook his head. Why should he explain his reasons to the innkeeper? &#x2018;It is essential that I reach the abbey before midnight.&#x2019;&#x2018;Well, Brother, you will never make it on foot, even if you knew the roads. What could be so important that the difference of a day might count?&#x2019;Brother Eadulf&#x2019;s brows came together in annoyance.&#x2018;I have my reasons,&#x2019; he said stubbornly.Cynric shook his head sadly. &#x2018;You outlanders are all the same. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Well, you will have to bend before the wind this night for you have no other option.&#x2019;&#x2018;I am not a stranger in this land, my friend,&#x2019; protested Eadulf, irritated at the other&#x2019;s use of the word &#x2018;outlander&#x2019;. &#x2018;I am Eadulf of Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham and was the hereditary <i>gerefa</i> of that place before I took the tonsure of St Peter.&#x2019;The innkeeper&#x2019;s eyes widened. A <i>gerefa</i> was a man of local importance, holding the rank of a magistrate.&#x2018;Forgive me, Brother. I thought that you spoke our language too well. But I had assumed, as you travelled in the company of an Irish religieuse, that you were of that nation.&#x2019;Eadulf was defensive. &#x2018;I have been in foreign lands for a while. But, <i>Deo</i> <i>adiuvante,</i> with God&#x2019;s help, I will see Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham, my native place, in time for Christ&#x2019;s Mass.&#x2019;&#x2018;Four days to go then, Brother. But why stop at Aldred&#x2019;s Abbey? Why not wait until the storm clears and then go straight on to Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham which is only a little distance beyond?&#x2019;&#x2018;Because ... because I have my reasons for doing so,&#x2019; Eadulf replied tersely.The innkeeper pursed his lips at Eadulf&#x2019;s agitated reticence. He shrugged and went to the fire. The inn was deserted. No one else had managed to make their way to the snowbound crossroads where it was situated. The innkeeper bent to a pile of logs and lifted one, balancing it in his arms for a moment before dumping it on the fire.&#x2018;You will find many things altered in this land, Brother,&#x2019; he said as he turned from the hearth. &#x2018;In fact, you have been lucky to reach here in safety.&#x2019;&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve seen snows before and travelled through blizzards that would put this&#x2019; &#x2014; Eadulf gestured with his hand towards the door - &#x2018;to shame. What threat in that?&#x2019;&#x2018;I was not thinking so much of the weather. Man is often more cruel than nature&#x2019;s elements, my friend. In many places now, the Christian communities are under siege and attack. There is much animosity towards the new faith.&#x2019;&#x2018;Under siege and attack? From whom?&#x2019; demanded Eadulf, reluctantly taking a seat at the side of the fire, while the innkeeper went to draw a tankard of cider from a wooden barrel.&#x2018;From those who have returned to the worship of Woden, who else? In the kingdom of the East Saxons there is civil war between Sigehere, the King, and his own cousin, the Prince Sebbi. Not only do they fight for the kingship, but each represents one of the two beliefs. Surely you must have travelled through the land of the East Saxons to get here? You must have seen something of the conflict?&#x2019;Eadulf shook his head and reached forward to take the tankard from Cynric&#x2019;s hand. He sipped at it cautiously. It was sweet and strong.&#x2018;I did not know that there were such divisions which had caused actual warfare,&#x2019; he said, after he had taken another sip. &#x2018;Sigehere and Sebbi were both firmly on the path of Christ when I left this kingdom and there was no animosity between them.&#x2019;&#x2018;As you say, they were both Christians. But when the Yellow Plague struck among the East Saxons two years ago, Sigehere came to the belief that it was a punishment of the old gods on those who had renounced them and so he turned his back on the new faith and reopened the pagan temples. His cousin, Sebbi, has remained true to the new faith. Both have followers who ravage the countryside, burning the sacred sites of the other&#x2019;s religion and killing the religious who fall into their hands, whether they be of Christ or of Woden and the old gods.&#x2019;Eadulf was shocked. In Canterbury, he had heard some talk about the dissensions among the East Saxons but no one had spoken of actual violence or warfare. He shivered slightly, remembering that he had almost decided to journey from Kent through the kingdom of the East Saxons to get to the land of the South Folk. As the innkeeper had assumed, it would have been the normal route for wayfarers into this land. It was by chance that, having left Canterbury and gone north to join the road at the small port of Hwita&#x2019;s Staple, Eadulf had encountered an old acquaintance. Stuf, a sea-captain who ran his vessel along the coast of the Saxon kingdoms, had persuaded him to take passage directly to the land of the South Folk. This had cut several days from the journey. Stuf&#x2019;s vessel had landed Eadulf at the township called St Felix&#x2019;s Stowe, where the blessed missionary had established an abbey some twenty years before. Thanks to the chance meeting with Stuf, Eadulf had bypassed the volatile kingdom of the East Saxons.&#x2018;It was lucky then, innkeeper, that we came here by way of the sea from the kingdom of Kent,&#x2019; he reflected.&#x2018;Ah, so you did not come through the lands of Sigehere and Sebbi?&#x2019; Cynric&#x2019;s puzzled face lightened a little. &#x2018;You were blessed in your choice of route. But even here among the South Folk there is some friction between Christian and pagan. The conflict has spilt over the border and Sigehere is trying to stir up the dissension so that he might find allies among us. Outlaws prowl the marshlands and, of course, we also have to contend with threats of war from our western neighbour, Mercia. They mount constant raids against us.&#x2019;&#x2018;When was Mercia not a threat to the kingdom of the East Anglians?&#x2019; Eadulf smiled with grim cynicism. All through his life, he could remember little else but the continued warfare between the East Anglian kingdom and the Mercians.&#x2018;Our King, Ealdwulf, has recently rejected the King of Mercia&#x2019;s s demands that East Anglia pay him tribute. Since Ealdwulf&#x2019;s mother, Hereswith, is a princess of the Northumbrian royal house, we can expect an alliance to keep the Mercian threat in check. We have good prospects before us if King Ealdwulf can keep the internal conflict between pagan and Christian from spreading here. And this is what I warn you of, Eadulf of Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham. Do not assume that everyone will greet you and your companion as friends and respect your cloth. There is much bitterness abroad in our land. Some thanes have even threatened to declare allegiance to Sigehere of the East Saxons unless King Ealdwulf renounces Christianity. There is much trouble brewing, Brother. You have chosen a dangerous time to return home.&#x2019;Brother Eadulf sighed deeply. &#x2018;So it seems.&#x2019;Cynric placed another log on the fire. At that moment the door on the far side of the room opened, and a tall, red-haired religieuse entered. She smiled quickly at Eadulf.&#x2018;My robes are dry now and I am warmer than when we arrived.&#x2019; She spoke in Irish which was the common language between them. &#x2018;I think that I would like some mulled wine to give warmth to the inner body.&#x2019;Eadulf returned her smile warmly and gestured to a chair by the fire near him.&#x2018;I doubt that a Saxon inn will have wine, but there is good cider, or mead if you wish.&#x2019;&#x2018;Cider before mead if there is no wine,&#x2019; she replied.The innkeeper stood patiently during this exchange, not understanding.&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t suppose you have wine, innkeeper?&#x2019; Eadulf asked.&#x2018;You would be wrong if you had supposed it, Brother. Where would I be able to purchase wine, and if I did so who would buy it? The shipments of wine that are landed at Felix&#x2019;s Stowe go mainly to the abbey there or to some of the other monasteries along the coast. You&#x2019;ll find wine at Aldred&#x2019;s Abbey but not here.&#x2019;&#x2018;Then serve my companion some of your best cider.&#x2019;The innkeeper looked at the religieuse and asked Eadulf: &#x2018;Your companion does not speak Saxon, then?&#x2019; He was surprised when the tall religieuse turned and spoke to him in a halting fashion.&#x2018;Enough to follow the conversation in general terms, innkeeper. But my knowledge is not good enough to understand all the nuances of your tongue.&#x2019;The innkeeper bowed his head a moment in reflection. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve heard it said that the people of Ireland are versed in all the languages of the world.&#x2019;&#x2018;You flatter my people. Our missionaries certainly try to achieve proficiency in several tongues to accomplish their task. Latin, Greek, a little Hebrew, and the languages of our neighbours. But our ability is neither greater nor less than that of others given the same circumstances and opportunities.&#x2019;Eadulf nodded approvingly, overlooking one or two small lapses in grammar.The innkeeper filled another tankard and handed it to her. While Fidelma sipped appreciatively, Eadulf ordered a meat pie, which Cynric told him was a speciality of the inn, for their supper.&#x2018;This innkeeper says that we will not reach Aldred&#x2019;s Abbey this night,&#x2019; Eadulf began, when Cynric had vanished to prepare the meal.&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x2019; replied Fidelma solemnly with a glance towards the tiny, snow-blocked window. &#x2018;I have never felt it so cold, or seen snow so like little flecks of ice.&#x2019;&#x2018;Yet Brother Botulf was specific. He wanted me to arrive at the abbey before midnight tonight. The message he sent to me at Canterbury was underlined at that point.&#x2019;&#x2018;He must make allowances for the weather,&#x2019; rejoined Fidelma, with a shrug. &#x2018;This storm puts the matter entirely out of your hands.&#x2019;&#x2018;Nevertheless, why did he underline the time and date?&#x2019;&#x2018;You say that this ... Botulf? I find your Saxon names still difficult to pronounce. You say that Botulf is a good friend of yours?&#x2019;Eadulf nodded swiftly. &#x2018;We grew up together. He must be in serious trouble, otherwise he would not have written such a message.&#x2019;&#x2018;But he did not explain anything in the message. He must take your friendship for granted if he presumed that you would leave Canterbury and come rushing to him.&#x2019;&#x2018;He would guess that if I was at Canterbury, then I would be travelling to my home at Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham. He would assume that my path would lie by his door,&#x2019; replied Eadulf defensively. &#x2018;My home is only six miles further on from the abbey.&#x2019;&#x2018;A strange friend, that is all I say,&#x2019; sighed Fidelma. &#x2018;Is he the abbot of this abbey?&#x2019;Eadulf shook his head. &#x2018;He is the steward. I was told at Canterbury that someone called Cild is the abbot, but I have never heard of him.&#x2019;Cynric re-entered, bearing a tray with a hot meat pie on it which he set down at a nearby table.&#x2018;If you will be seated at the table, I shall fetch more cider with which to wash your meal down.&#x2019;The pie looked and smelled good and soon the howling wind outside was forgotten as they savoured the meal. Eadulf explained something of what Cynric had told him about the conflict between the Christians and pagans. Sister Fidelma looked at her companion with some sympathy.&#x2018;It must be difficult for you to hear this. However, it is surely balanced against the pleasure of seeing your home again.&#x2019;&#x2018;It is a long time since I was last at Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham. I am indeed looking forward to seeing it again.&#x2019; He glanced anxiously at her. &#x2018;I am sorry if I seem selfish, Fidelma.&#x2019;Her eyes widened for a moment. She was thinking that <i>she</i> was being selfish. She had suddenly realised just how much she was missing her home in Cashel. This land of the South Folk was bleak, cold and inhospitable. When she had agreed to accompany Eadulf to Canterbury and had left the shores of her homeland, it had not occurred to her that he would want to proceed further and journey on to the place of his birth. But that, she realised, had been a silly and egocentric assumption on her part. Of course, after the time in Rome and then nearly a year in her brother&#x2019;s kingdom of Muman, it was obvious that Eadulf would want to spend some time at his birthplace.She tried to suppress the apprehensive feeling that came over her. She hoped that he would not want to spend any great length of time at that place ... Seaxmund&#x2019;s Ham. She felt guilty for the selfish thought. Why should she expect him to want to return to her own country? But she did miss her homeland. She had travelled enough. She wanted to settle down.She realised that Eadulf was smiling at her across the table.&#x2018;No regrets?&#x2019; he asked.She felt the hot blood in her cheeks.&#x2018;...</p><h2>The Cure of Poetry in an Age of Prose: Moral Essays on the Poet&#39;s Calling</h2><p>The role of the poet, Mary Kinzie writes, is to engage the most profound subjects with the utmost in expressive clarity. The role of the critic is to follow the poet, word for word, into the arena where the creative struggle occurs. How this mutual purpose is served, ideally and practically, is the subject of this bracingly polemical collection of essays. <br><br>A distinguished poet and critic, Kinzie assesses poetry's situation during the past twenty-five years. Ours, she contends, is literally a prosaic age, not only in the popularity of prose genres but in the resultant compromises with truth and elegance in literature. In essays on "the rhapsodic fallacy," confessionalism, and the romance of perceptual response, Kinzie diagnoses some of the trends that diminish the poet's flexibility. Conversely, she also considers individual poets&#x2014;Randall Jarrell, Elizabeth Bishop, Howard Nemerov, Seamus Heaney, and John Ashbery&#x2014;who have found ingenious ways of averting the risks of prosaism and preserving the special character of poetry. <br><br>Focusing on poet Louise Bogan and novelist J. M. Coetzee, Kinzie identifies a crucial and curative overlap between the practices of great prose-writing and great poetry. In conclusion, she suggests a new approach for teaching writers of poetry <i>and</i> fiction. Forcefully argued, these essays will be widely read and debated among critics and poets alike.</p><p><b>Mary Kinzie</b>is a poet and critic.&nbsp; She is professor of English and director of&nbsp;creative writing at Northwestern University, where she teaches poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction.&nbsp; She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in Poetry and the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x2019;s O.

Having developed an intense understanding of the preciousness of life from his wartime experience, Osamu Tezuka aimed to become a physician and later earned his degree in medicine, but ultimately chose the profession he loved best: manga artist and animated film writer.<br><br>Tezuka's manga and animated films had a tremendous impact on the shaping of the psychology of Japan's postwar youth.

Osamu Tezuka lived out his entire life tirelessly pursuing his efforts, passing away at the age of 60 on February 8, 1989.<br><br>In all, Tezuka produced more than 150,000 pages of graphic storytelling before his death. Posthumously Tezuka's work have won a number of awards in the U.S., including the 2009 Eisner Award given to his series Dororo.&#x201c;What makes Black Jack so great, in addition to Tezuka&#x2019;s artwork and whirlwind narrative velocity (you can either breeze through these volumes or linger on the details), is his bottomless bag of stories. Tezuka effortlessly integrates scores of different surgical procedures into short, sharp tales that eviscerate the codified vicissitudes (especially reticence and duty) of Japanese society with, yes, surgical precision.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard Gehr, The Village Voice<br><br>&#x201c;Manga master Osamu Tezuka may be best known for Astro Boy, but this installment of Black Jack continues the adventures of a far superior character... With his shock of white hair and rock-star demeanour, Black Jack transfers well to the manga version of the operating room. The book is peppered with enough knowledge to hint at Tezuka&#x2019;s fascination with the frailty of the human body. [I]t means he can avoid the clich�s of most manga storylines.&#x201d;&#x2014;The Guardian (U.K.)<br>&#x201c;Black Jack is a dramatic, nearly Byronic figure... With genre-spanning stories&#x2014;horror, sci-fi, romance&#x2014; and Tezuka&#x2019;s signature blend of drama, bathos, and extreme broad comedy jammed together on every page, Black Jack is a wild but extravagantly entertaining ride that&#x2019;s far more accessible than the author&#x2019;s novel-length epics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)</p><h2>Sra Skill Series: Sss LV B Locating the Answer</h2><p>SRA is helpful reading comprehension tool for parents and students.</p><p></p><h2>Rifts Index and Adventures Volume 1</h2><p>Rifts Index &amp; Adventures: Volume One is a combination index, sourcebook and adventure book!

Until this book was published, the Battle of the Armada had been told primarily from the English viewpoint, the English victory puffed up into a national heroic tale which was far from the truth. There is another side to this story, however, and, basing his narrative on previously unexplored Spanish sources, David Howarth, brilliantly redressed the balance.</p><p>In May of 1588, on the order of Spain's King Philip, 30,000 soldiers and sailors armed with arquebus and musket set out to sea. A larger fleet had never before been assembled. In the Voyage of the Armada, David Howarth brilliantly conveys the drama of the Spanish Armada's progress and brings to life the personalities of the men who influenced its course, from the dogmatic and irrational Philip II to Don Juan Martinez de Recalde to Don Pedro and Don Diego de Valdes, who were cousins but also bitter enemies, to the Spanish soldiers and sailors who unquestioningly ventured into unknown seas to confront their fates. Basing his narrative on previously unexplored Spanish sources, David Howarth shows that there is always another side to every conflict. The Voyage of the Armada recounts the adventures of these brave men as they go from battles to storms to wrecks and then finally - for the lucky ones - return home.

In peacetime he remained in Shetland, and it was then that he started his writing career. Some of his books include The Shetland Bus, Dawn of D-Day. and Waterloo: A Near Run Thing.

After four attempts on his life, he ends up seeking the help of the enigmatic and unorthodox amateur sleuth, Albert Campion. After Campion bundles Lobbett off to a country house in Mystery Mile deep in the Suffolk countryside, all manner of adventures ensue. It&#39;s a race against time for Campion to get the judge to safety and decipher the clue to their mysterious enemy&#39;s name.</p><p>Margery Louise Allingham is ranked among the most distinguished and beloved detective fiction writers of the Golden Age alongside Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Ngaio Marsh. Allingham is J.K. Rowling&#39;s favourite Golden Age author and Agatha Christie said of Allingham that out of all the detective stories she remembers, Margery Allingham &#39;stands out like a shining light&#39;. She was born in Ealing, London in 1904 to a very literary family; her parents were both writers, and her aunt ran a magazine, so it was natural that Margery too would begin writing at an early age. She wrote steadily through her school days, first in Colchester and later as a boarder at the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she wrote, produced, and performed in a costume play. After her return to London in 1920 she enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where she studied drama and speech training in a successful attempt to overcome a childhood stammer. There she met Phillip Youngman Carter, who would become her husband and collaborator, designing the jackets for many of her future books. The Allingham family retained a house on Mersea Island, a few miles from Layer Breton, and it was here that Margery found the material for her first novel, the adventure story Blackkerchief Dick (1923), which was published when she was just nineteen. She went on to pen multiple novels, some of which dealt with occult themes and some with mystery, as well as writing plays and stories - her first detective story, The White Cottage Mystery, was serialized in the Daily Express in 1927. Allingham died at the age of 62, and her final novel, A Cargo of Eagles, was finished by her husband at her request and published posthumously in 1968.Albert Campion takes on the usual collection of unbelievable, yet charming, characters. The eccentric cast, focusing on an American judge pursued by the ominous Simister gang, is given a range of voices by narrator Francis Matthews. Though Matthews has recorded numerous Allingham titles, the husky American accents and servants&#39; dialects are somewhat distracting. The secondary characters are slightly exaggerated while the central characters&#39; accents are restrained. The narrator does lead the reader adeptly through the twists of the tale and presents an accomplished interpretation. Another of Campion&#39;s &#34;adventures undertaken for a small fee,&#34; this will undoubtedly give satisfaction to the enthusiast. R.F.W.

She has written more than one hundred historical novels and novellas, more than thirty of which have been &#34;New York Times &#34;bestsellers. They include the Bedwyn saga, the Simply quartet, the Huxtable quintet, and the seven-part Survivors Club series.&#34;<p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Crabbe, Duke of Stanbrook, stood at the foot of the steps outside his London home on Grosvenor Square, his right hand still raised in farewell<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even though the carriage bearing his two cousins on their journey home to Cumberland was already out of sight. They had made an early start despite the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that a few forgotten items, or items they feared they had forgotten, had twice delayed their departure while first a maid and then the housekeeper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; herself hurried upstairs to look in their vacated rooms just in case.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret and Audrey were sisters and his second cousins to be precise. They had come to London for the wedding of Imogen Hayes, Lady Barclay, to Percy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl of Hardford. Audrey was the bride&#x2019;s mother. Imogen had stayed at Stanbrook House too until her wedding two days ago, partly because she was a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative, but mainly because there was no one in the world George loved more. There were five others he loved equally well, it was true, though Imogen<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the only woman and the only one related to him. The seven of them, himself included, were the members of the self-styled Survivors&#x2019; Club.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little over eight years ago George had made the decision to open Penderris Hall, his country seat in Cornwall, as a hospital and recovery center for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; military officers who had been severely wounded in the Napoleonic Wars and needed more intense and more extended care than could be provided by their<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; families. He had hired a skilled physician and other staff members willing to act as nurses, and he had handpicked the patients from among those<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended to him. There had been more than two dozen in all, most of whom had survived and returned to their families or regiments after a few weeks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or months. But six had remained for three years. Their injuries had varied widely. Not all had been physical. Hugo Emes, Lord Trentham, for example,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had been brought there without a scratch on his body but out of his mind and with a straitjacket restraining him from doing violence to himself or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep bond had developed among the seven of them, an attachment too strong to be severed even after they left Penderris and returned to their separate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lives. Those six people meant more to George than anyone else still living&#x2014;though perhaps that was not quite accurate, for he was dearly fond too of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his only nephew, Julian, and of Julian&#x2019;s wife, Philippa, and their infant daughter, Belinda. He saw them with fair frequency too and always with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure. They lived only a few miles from Penderris. Love, of course, did not move in hierarchies of preference. Love manifested itself in a thousand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different ways, all of which were love in its entirety. A strange thing, that, if one stopped to think about it.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lowered his hand, feeling suddenly foolish to be waving farewell to empty air, and turned back to the house. A footman hovered at the door, no doubt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anxious to close it. He was probably shivering in his shoes. A brisk early morning breeze was blowing across the square directly at him though there<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was plenty of blue sky above along with some scudding clouds in promise of a lovely mid-May day.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded to the young man and sent him to the kitchen to fetch coffee to the library.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning post had not arrived yet, he could see when he entered the room. The surface of the large oak desk before the window was bare except for a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clean blotter and an inkpot and two quill pens. There would be the usual pile of invitations when the post did arrive, it being the height of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London Season. He would be required to choose among balls and soirees and concerts and theater groups and garden parties and Venetian breakfasts and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private dinners and a host of other entertainments. Meanwhile his club offered congenial company and diversion, as did Tattersall&#x2019;s and the races and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his tailor and boot maker. And if he did not wish to go out, he was surrounded in this very room by bookshelves that reached from floor to ceiling,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupted only by doors and windows. If there was room for one more book on any of the shelves, he would be surprised. There were even a few books<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among them that he had not yet read but would doubtless enjoy.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a pleasant feeling to know that he might do whatever he wished with his time, even nothing at all if he so chose. The weeks leading up to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imogen&#x2019;s wedding and the few days since had been exceedingly busy ones and had allowed him very little time to himself. But he had enjoyed the busyness<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and had to admit that there was a certain flatness mingled with his pleasure this morning in the knowledge that yet again he was alone and free and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beholden to no one. The house seemed very quiet, even though his cousins had not been noisy or demanding houseguests. He had enjoyed their company far<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than he had expected. They were virtual strangers, after all. He had not seen either sister for a number of years before this past week.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imogen herself was the closest of friends but could have caused some upheaval due to her impending nuptials. She had not. She was not a fussy bride in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the least. One would hardly have known, in fact, that she was preparing for her wedding, except that there had been a new and unfamiliar glow about her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that had warmed George&#x2019;s heart.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wedding breakfast had been held at Stanbrook House. He had insisted upon it, though both Ralph and Flavian, their fellow Survivors, had offered to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; host it too. Half the <i>ton</i> had been present, filling the ballroom almost to overflowing and inevitably spilling out into other rooms in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hours following the meal and all the speeches. And <i>breakfast</i> was certainly a misnomer, since very few of the guests had left until late in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evening.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George had enjoyed every moment.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the festivities were all over, and after the wedding Imogen had left with Percy for a honeymoon in Paris. Now Audrey and Margaret were gone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; too, although before leaving they had hugged him tightly, thanked him effusively for his hospitality, and begged him to come and stay with them in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cumberland sometime soon.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a strong sense of finality about this morning. There had been a flurry of weddings in the last two years, including those of all the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survivors and George&#x2019;s nephew, all the people most dear to him in the world. Imogen had been the last of them&#x2014;with the exception of himself, of course.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he hardly counted. He was forty-eight years old and, after eighteen years of marriage, he had been a widower for more than twelve years.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was glad to see that the fire in the library had been lit. He had got chilled standing outside. He took the chair to one side of the fireplace and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held out his hands to the blaze. The footman brought the tray a few minutes later, poured his coffee, and set the cup and saucer on the small table<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beside him along with a plate of sweet biscuits that smelled of butter and nutmeg.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; George added milk and a little sugar to the dark brew and remembered for no apparent reason how it had always irritated his wife that he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledged even the slightest service paid him by a servant. Doing so would only lower him in their esteem, she had always explained to him.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed almost incredible that all six of his fellow Survivors had married within the past two years. It was as if they had needed the three years<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after leaving Penderris to adjust to the outside world again after the sheltered safety the house had provided during their recovery, but had then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rushed joyfully back into full and fruitful lives. Perhaps, having hovered for so long close to death and insanity, they had needed to celebrate life<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself. He was quite certain too that they had all made happy marriages. Hugo and Vincent each had a child already, and there was another on the way<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Vincent and Sophia. Ralph and Flavian were also in expectation of fatherhood. Even Ben, another of their number, had whispered two days ago that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samantha had been feeling queasy for the past few mornings and was hopeful that it was in a good cause.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all thoroughly heartwarming to the man who had opened his home and his heart to men&#x2014;and one woman&#x2014;who had been broken by war and might have<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remained forever on the fringes of their own lives if he had not done so. If they had survived at all, that was.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George looked speculatively at the biscuits but did not take one. He picked up his coffee cup, however, and warmed his hands about it, ignoring the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handle.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it downright contrary of him to be feeling ever so slightly depressed this morning? Imogen&#x2019;s wedding had been a splendidly festive and happy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occasion. George loved to see her glow, and, despite some early misgivings, he liked Percy too and thought it probable he was the perfect husband for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her. George was very fond of the wives of the other Survivors too. In many ways he felt like a smugly proud father who had married off his brood to so<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many happily-ever-afters.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that was the trouble, though. For he was not their father, was he? Or anyone else&#x2019;s for that matter. He frowned into his coffee, considered<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding more sugar, decided against doing so, and took another sip. His only son had died at the age of seventeen during the early years of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsular Wars, and his wife&#x2014;Miriam&#x2014;had taken her own life just a few months later.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, George thought as he gazed sightlessly into his cup, very much alone&#x2014;though no more so now than he had been before Imogen&#x2019;s wedding and all the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others. Julian was his late brother&#x2019;s son, not his own, and his six fellow Survivors had all left Penderris Hall five years ago. Although the bonds of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship had remained strong and they all gathered for three weeks every year, usually at Penderris, they were not literally family. Even Imogen was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only his second cousin once removed.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had moved on with their lives, those six, and left him behind. And what a blasted pathetic, self-pitying thought <i>that</i> was.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George drained his cup, set it down none too gently on the saucer, put both on the tray, and got restlessly to his feet. He moved behind the desk and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stood looking out through the window onto the square. It was still early enough that there was very little activity out there. The clouds were sparser<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they had been earlier, the sky a more uniform blue. It was the sort of day designed to lift the human spirit.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was lonely, damn it. To the marrow of his bones and the depths of his soul.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He almost always had been.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His adult life had begun brutally early. He had taken up a military commission with great excitement at the age of seventeen, having convinced his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father that a career in the army was what he wanted more than anything else in life. But just four months later he had been summoned back home when his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father had learned that he was dying. Before he turned eighteen, George had sold out his cornetcy, married Miriam, lost his f...</p></p><h2>Art, Passion &amp; Power: The Story of the Royal Collection.</h2><p><p>"Hall&#x2019;s consummate history is not just the story of the evolution of one of the world&#x2019;s great collections...

His friends and enemies were among the celebrated and the powerful, the illustrious and infamous. He saw history being made. He made history himself. These are the memoirs of Hamilton Fish: his colorful life, the people who were a part of it and the world events he was instrumental in shaping. &#34;Politics was in my family&#39;s blood, so it was no surprise when I entered the field myself, &#34; observed Hamilton Fish. His great grandfather was the first adjutant general of the state of New York; his grandfather was governor of New York, a U.S. senator, a U.S. representative, and secretary of state for President Ulysses S. Grant; his father was a U.S. representative and served as assistant U.S. treasurer. Hamilton Fish joined their ranks in 1912 when he was appointed chairman of the Putnam County, New York, Bull Moose Party. Elected to the New York Legislature, with Franklin D. Roosevelt he fought political corruption and the power of the bosses and their political machines. During World War I, Fish was made captain of the 369th U.S. Infantry Regiment, the all black regiment known as the &#34;Harlem Hellfighters.&#34; His distinguished service won him the Silver Star for Bravery. Two years after the Armistice, he was elected to Congress, a seat he held for twenty-five years. &#34;I have devoted my life to serving the American people by doing what I could to secure for them their civil rights, regardless of the color of their skin, and by protecting our country against her enemies, both foreign and domestic.&#34; During his lifetime, Hamilton Fish worked unceasingly for civil rights for black Americans. He wastireless in his battles against communism which, he believed, was &#34;no idle threat but a very real menace to peace.&#34; He was an early and dedicated supporter of the Jewish people and their right to a national homeland. Fish also vividly recalls his long political</p><p>The late ex-congressman offers a first-person history of the 20th century enlivened by his role through 90 of its years as a key player on the national and international stage. Names of family, friends, allies, and adversaries fill the book as they would a "Who's Who." With a large part of the book covering 1923 to 1945, Fish paints an unflattering portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt as arrogant, power hungry, and deceptive. Opposing FDR on many issues--New Deal programs, Court packing, the creation of war hysteria, and Lend-Lease--he also reflected the antiwar sentiment and struggled to keep the United States out of war. Fish's prominent role in Congress ended in 1944, but his concern for America's best interests continued to his death. An epilog by Brian Mitchell provides personal insights.

Curated by Susan Davidson, this long-awaited exhibition to be held at the Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Guggenheim Bilbao and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice considers the artist's works on paper as an essential component in his signature transformation of the traditional figurative line into a non-figurative graphic expression. This catalogue of the exhibiton begins chronologically with Pollock's early sketchbook studies based on old master paintings by Michelangelo and El Greco, as well as those influenced by his contemporaries, mainly the Mexican muralists Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. These early works reveal a figurative treatment that Pollock ultimately rejected as he moved at first toward pieces that mirrored his advancements in painting, and eventually, by late 1947, to abstract compositions. Throughout his career, Pollock experimented with different media on paper, alternating the same themes on watercolor and lithography, and later adding gouache to engravings to provide interesting variations. In the last years of his life, Pollock's fascination with different types of paper led him to special handmade sheets that allowed the paint to permeate below the main layer, thus achieving fortuitous variations of his well-known poured painting technique. This fully illustrated catalogue, which shows the full range of Pollock's works on paper, includes a reassessment of his skills as a draftsman by David Anfam, a noted scholar of Abstract Expressionism. Susan Davidson contributes a text that focuses on Pollock's stylistic development and the reception of his works on paper during his lifetime. A technical analysis of Pollock's working method is provided by Margaret Hoben Ellis.</p><p></p><h2>Good Night, Alfie Atkins</h2><p><b>An irresistible father-and-son team!</b><br><br>Meet Alfie Atkins. Like all four-year-olds, sometimes he is stubborn. Tonight he doesn't want to go to bed. Lucky for him, Daddy is being especially nice -- taking care of all of Alfie's bedtime needs. But Alfie won't sleep, and it isn't long before he succeeds in tiring poor Daddy.<br></p><p><b>Gunilla Bergstrom</b>'s first children's book was published<br>in 1971 and has been followed by about thirty others, many of<br>them part of her acclaimed series featuring Alfie Atkins.<br>PreSchool-Grade 2-Four-year-old Alfie Atkins does not want to go to sleep. His father assists him in a variety of bedtime rituals, but still the child asks for more. When he calls for his teddy, Daddy does not come, so Alfie goes looking for him and finds his exhausted parent asleep on the floor. He tucks him in and then goes to sleep himself. The book was originally published in 1972 in Sweden, and the stylized art features a palette that will cry out "1970s" to adults (scraps of fabric incorporated into the pictures add an interesting texture to the bold colors). The father smokes a pipe throughout. The old-fashioned aspects of the illustrations are likely to be lost on children. This timeless story features a father-son interaction without unnecessary fanfare, but has limited child appeal.<i>-Genevieve Gallagher, Murray Elementary School, Charlottesville, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The demand for mostly printed fabrics for use by the fashion department, in interior decoration schemes for well-to-do clients and for sale to the public was met by original designs from around 100 artists, including the association's co-founder Josef Hoffmann and other leading figures such as Dagobert Peche, Carl Otto Czeschka, Maria Likarz and Max Snischek.

These range from the early rounded naturalistic motifs of Art Nouveau to later angular geometric designs associated with Art Deco, their history and development being fully documented in invaluable archival and documentary records.

In a strange old house, they gradually come together, mixing their arcane skills and life-styles, falling in and out of love and changing the world around them forever. You have never seen their like before.</p><p>High on a hill by a forked tree, the House beckons its family homeward, and they come--travelers from the lyrical, lush imagination of Ray Bradbury. <p> <i>From the Dust Returned</i> chronicles a community of eternal beings: a mummified matriarch who speaks in dust; a sleeping daughter who lives through the eyes and ears of the creatures she visits in her dreams; an uncle with wings like sea-green sails. And there is also the mortal child Timothy, the foundling son who yearns to be like those he loves: to fly, to sleep in daytime, and to live forever. Instead, his task is to witness the family's struggle with the startling possibility of its own end.</p><p> Bradbury is deservedly recognized as a master of lyricism and delicate mood. In this novel he weaves together individuals' stories and the overarching family crisis into a softly whispered, seductive tale of longing and loss, death and life in the shadowy places. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p>Ray Bradbury is one of the Twentieth Century&#39;s most celebrated writers of fiction.

It was a world of dark forests and Viking adventures in which fear was real and death a constant companion. People felt they walked hand-in-hand with God, and envisaged him so literally that even Christians were sometimes buried with supplies for the journey to the new life in heaven. Narrated through the progression of the seasons, this book presents a recreation of English life at the end of the first millennium AD.</p><p></p><h2>How to Be a Muppet</h2><p>A guide to all the Muppet characters for younger fans.</p><p></p><h2>Alberto Pinto: Classics</h2><p>With an international clientele--among whom may be numbered royalty, giants of industry, and leaders of state--it is no wonder that interior designer and decorator of renown Alberto Pinto feels himself best suited to the shadows--albeit the shadows of the great. From this privileged position he subtly shapes lifestyles and, to a certain extent, the images of princes.<br><br>In <i>Alberto Pinto: Classics</i>, author Philippe Renaud offers us an intimate glimpse of Pinto's world, a world of exquisite luxury and opulence, a world in which, by Pinto's hand, elegance and abundance are brought to balance in harmonious accord. We are shown the magnificent interiors of apartments in New York, mansions in Paris, villas on the Riviera, country houses in England, and palaces in Cairo. We are also brought to a ranch in the deserts of New Mexico and to the ocean-side hills of Long Island's elegant Hamptons.<br><br>Here we find Pinto's cultivated but decidedly eclectic approach to design--an indirect result, perhaps, of his having grown up in post-colonial Casablanca. His roots are Moroccan--under the certain influence of Paris. Of course, his work is more than this: it is an amalgam of British chic, French elegance, and American rationalism; it is a manipulation of classical styles with a twist; it is frequently a brilliantly daring tendency to juxtaposition and apparent paradox in which a surrealistic painting by Magritte might hang below a Neoclassical bust--all of this ultimately resounding in an affirmation of Alberto Pinto as <i>the</i> interior designer and decorator of choice.<br></p><p><b>Philippe Renaud</b>, the author, is also author of <i>Mon nounours a des bobos</i>.

Tolkien observed that the word Celtic &#34;is a magic bag, into which anything may be put, and out of which almost anything may come . . . Anything is possible in the fabulous Celtic twilight, which is not so much a twilight of the gods as of the reason.&#34; But in this enjoyable and lucid IVP Histories volume, Ted Olsen digs beneath the layers of romanticization to introduce you to the world of the Celts. Focusing on their interaction with the Christian faith, Olsen tells the stories of principal characters from Ireland and beyond. As he illuminates the missionary fervor and monastic ideals of saints such as Patrick and Columbanus, Olsen brings a distant period of history to vivid life. Here is an engaging portrait of men and women whose ability to intrigue and fascinate is as strong as it ever was.</p><p>Ted Olsen is Online and Managing Editor for 'Christianity Today' in the USA.

Written in the middle of the 19th century, it details some of the notorious trials of the burning times, a few tales of Satan, and a pair of extremely interesting stories from antiquity, including the infamous Lamia. Its treatment of these subjects is at once full of secular-era ridicule and the twain tendency of the times to render all non-christian activities to the explicitly fallen and degenerated. In doing so however this work is not, as some from the era, made less effective. It is a wonderful short guide to witch hunting and demonology.</p><p></p><h2>American Medical Association Family Medical Guide</h2><p>Thoroughly revised, this comprehensive medical reference incorporates the latest trends in health care, emphasizing wellness and preventive medicine, updating current health issues, and featuring information on the latest in technology and treatment options. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>first published in 1982, <b>The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide</b> set a new standard for depth, authority, and accessibility.

She has more than twenty-three years of professional experience and is the author of <i>Heal Your Heart: The New Rice Diet Program for Reversing Heart Disease Through Nutrition, Exercise, and Spiritual Renewal.</i>Call it the anti-Atkins: instead of preaching the weight-loss potential of an endless steak and eggs buffet, this plan suggests a regimen rich in whole grains, beans, fruits and vegetables. The plan allows only limited amounts of dairy or animal protein, urges dieters to avoid salt, exercise regularly and keep a journal to chart their progress. Low-calorie eating and physical activity are commonsense methods of losing weight, and, for the most part, Rosati's level-headed approach is refreshing. Occasionally the author veers toward immoderation, disallowing chicken because it causes "a slight rise in blood pressure or cholesterol," and suggesting that a detoxification is necessary before starting in order to return the body to "a clean, natural state." In general, though, the author is straightforward and reassuring, and heartfelt testimonials from people who have lost huge amounts of weight provide encouragement. Even better, Rosati includes appealing recipes to help readers keep losing weight: Ryan's Crispy Fish Sticks are baked but have a just-fried crunch, and Ilene's Mashed Cauliflower is a deliciously garlicky substitute for mashed potatoes. Desserts, too, are fulfilling, especially a Rhubarb-Dried Cherry Crumble sweetened with fruit and maple syrup; with dozens more dishes to help dieters along, this a complete and satisfying plan. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The villain of this taut, riveting account of Wall Street's biggest scandal, which reads like a thriller, is arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, who is portrayed as an amoral liar who seduced Milken into illegal activities. Kornbluth, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair , interviewed Milken, his lawyers and his associates at length to produce a stunning tale of greed and self-deception packed with revelations and reconstructed conversations. He tells how Milken and his cronies at the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment firm hired several detective agencies (including a squad of ex-Mossad agents) to find out whether Boesky had socked away tens of millions of dollars in Swiss banks. He re-creates the turf war between the prosecutor in the case, ambitious U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Richard Breeden. He reveals that then-U.S. Attorney Gen. Dick Thornburgh overruled a possible settlement deal between Milken and the U.S. Attorney's office. He adds fresh details on the wheeling and dealing of T. Boone Pickens, Carl Icahn, Saul Steinberg, Steve Wynn and other high rollers. With rare insight, Kornbluth penetrates Milken's guru-like, deliberately ambiguous persona. A mad hunger for accumulation drove this Los Angeles-born middle-class Jewish prodigy, son of a rigid accountant, emotionally scarred by polio, to become a "high-performance machine," described by one colleague as "a borderline schizophrenic who reintegrates reality in a way that best suits him." Obsessed with remaining obscure, Milken, ironically, became the most notorious man in the securities industry. And Salomon Brothers, "the firm that wished Milken vaporized," is now the biggest buyer of junk bonds and an adviser to the government agency that sells the junk of seized S&amp;Ls--a cushy arrangement that Washington would never have allowed Drexel to enjoy.

She is the author of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. Darling was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a large and close-knit family. Painting was a popular family recreation, and almost every family excursion included one or more easels and a variety of sketch pads, chalks, paints, and pencils. For four years, the family lived on a hundred-acre farm in Kentucky. Here young Sandra grew especially fond of riding and training horses, and became a dog owner for the first time. Living in the country also provided plenty of time for reading, a life-long passion. </p><p>Sandra illustrated her first book in 1983: <i>The Teddy Bears' Picnic</i>, a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. That same year, she was visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when she came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image proved the inspiration for <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the seven sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients. </p><p>About her work Sandra says: "I think that one of the reasons my illustrations have appealed to people is that they can sense my sincerity. I know that marvels exist which are just outside our ordinary experience, but that at any moment we may turn a corner and encounter one of them. Children also believe this, and because they and I have this conviction in common, we, as creator and audience, make good partners." Sandra lives in Seattle, Washington with her husband, Harold.</p>Mice, a rottweiler, an arachnid and a few other assorted critters make sturdy reappearances in five board book versions of picture books. In Ellen Stoll Walsh's Mouse Paint, "three white mice on a white piece of paper" enjoy a colorful romp, while in Walsh's Mouse Count a similar gaggle narrowly escapes being served for dinner (Harcourt/Red Wagon, $6 each, 28p, ages 1-3 ISBN 0-15-200265-0; -200266-9 Sept.). Yet another mouse searches the animal kingdom for companionship?and finds an unexpected respondent?in Eric Carle's Do You Want to Be My Friend? (HarperFestival, $6.95, 32p, ages 2-6, ISBN 0-694-00709-9 Sept.). The rewards of industriousness are celebrated in a second Carle title, The Very Busy Spider; its embossed web brings a tactile dimension to his familiar collage artwork (Philomel, $9.95, 26p, ages 2-up ISBN 0-399-22919-1 Aug.). Finally, the canine in question is Alexandra Day's beloved Carl, who takes charge of a crew of toddlers in Carl Goes to Day Care (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $5.95, ages 1-3 ISBN 0-374-31145-5 Sept.).<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Inhabitants</h2><p>1946/1972.

Rebecca Young demanded of her youngest son, Benjamin. She tossed the water bucket to the side. Her body shook as fearful images built in her mind. "You could have been killed." The acrid smell of smoke in the early-morning air almost choked her as she fought for control. Benjamin might be adopted, but she loved him as much as she loved her daughter, Joy. The thought of losing him in a fire tore at her heart, leaving her feeling raw.<br><br>Black soot covered his young face and tears traced dirty tracks down his cheeks. He coughed, echoing coughs from others around them. The eight-year-old boy wrung his hands and shook his head from side to side. "I didn't mean for it to happen, Ma."<br><br>Fear and anger warred for control of her emotions. If Jacob hadn't seen the flames tearing through the barn and gotten Benjamin out, her youngest son would have died in the fire. She couldn't&#x2014;she heaved a deep sigh&#x2014;no, she <em>wouldn't</em> let her fear take the sting out of her scolding. "But it did happen, Benjamin. How many times have I told you not to take a lantern into the barn?"<br><br>The tears increased and dripped off his quivering chin. Big brandy-colored eyes met her gaze. Fear filled them. Was it fear of her, or the fact that he could have died in the fire? "I'm sorry, Ma." His voiced choked; he threw his arms around her waist and buried his head against her.<br><br>Rebecca ran her hands down his thin arms then embraced him tightly, unmindful of the black soot being smeared against the white of her apron.<br><br>Her gaze moved from one to the other of the six young men who stood in the yard. Her other adopted sons. Rebecca barely held back the tears, her heart winging a prayer of thanks that none of them were hurt putting out the flames.<br><br>Her oldest son, twenty-year-old Jacob, stared morosely at what used to be their barn.<br><br>The second oldest son, nineteen-year-old Andrew, kneeled on one knee at the edge of the clearing. He most likely desired privacy when he prayed, but that was a luxury big families couldn't afford. How she'd love to join him and thank the Lord for His protection. Each of the boys had learned early on from her deceased husband, John, to pray about everything. She couldn't help but be proud of Andrew for knowing where their help came from. Clayton, who'd just had his nineteenth birthday, dropped his water bucket, pure frustration lining his young face, and stomped back to the house. Rebecca knew he tried hard to hold in the pent-up fear and hopelessness that the burning barn caused and made a mental note to go to him as soon as she could.<br><br>Eighteen-year-old Thomas and eighteen-year-old Philip stood side by side, eyes darting back and forth, watching everything as it unfolded. The boys were best friends and had vowed to always stick together even before she and John adopted them.<br><br>Twelve-year-old Noah, the newest member of her family, looked ready to bolt. He stood frozen, motionless, waiting for what she would say or do next. He'd only been with her a couple of months and wasn't sure about anything yet. He reminded her of a hungry dog&#x2014;ready to fight if needed, but hoping for love and a little food to fill his belly.<br><br>The morning sun shone brightly over all of them now. But when the fire had first been detected, it had still been dark. Her boys had rushed to put out the flames, but they'd been no match for the heat radiating from the inferno. A heap of smoking, blackened timber filled the spot where the barn once stood. Thankfully, her five-year-old daughter, Joy, hadn't come out to assist.<br><br>If John had been here, this never would have happened. Once more the loss of her husband struck home. How often in the past eight months had she wished that he was still alive? Too often.<br><br>After twelve years of marriage it was hard to believe he was gone. The boy sobbing into her apron drew her thoughts away from the past and her sorrow. She stroked Benjamin's light brown hair.<br><br>An unfamiliar cough sounded and then a man cleared his throat. "I hate to disturb you, ma'am."<br><br>She had all but forgotten the stranger who had raced into the yard and jumped in to help put out the blaze. Rebecca released Benjamin and turned toward the man. "I'm sorry, Mr...." She waited for him to fill in his name.<br><br>"Seth Armstrong."<br><br>Rebecca wiped her hands on her apron. "Thank you, Mr. Armstrong, for stopping by to help put out the fire." Thanks to his help, the fire had been subdued faster than it normally would have taken, but not before they'd lost the barn and everything in it.<br><br>"I was happy to help, Mrs. Young," Seth answered, pulling her from her musings.<br><br>How did he know her name?<br><br>Before she could ask, Jacob barked out orders to the other boys. "Andrew, you and Philip go gather up the horses that arrived yesterday, put them in the training corral and feed them. Thomas, milk the cow and go get Clayton, tell him I said to find Brownie and Snowball and hitch up the wagon. We're going to town for lumber." He watched as the boys scrambled to do as he said.<br><br>"What do you want me to do?" Noah asked quietly.<br><br>Jacob walked over to the twelve-year-old and bent down to eye level. In a softer voice he asked, "Would you take Beni into the house and give him a good washing?"<br><br>Noah nodded. He walked over to Benjamin. "Come on, Beni. Jacob says we have to get you cleaned up." The two boys left the yard and Noah had planted his hand firmly on Benjamin's shoulder.<br><br>Jacob stood once more and came to stand beside Rebecca. She was very proud of her oldest son. John's death had hit him the hardest and he'd taken to heart her husband's last words&#x2014;to take care of the family.<br><br>Her gaze returned to Seth Armstrong. He was a big man with deep green eyes and black hair. His shoulders were wide. And his hair touched his collar. Rebecca wondered if she was in some sort of shock. What did it matter what the stranger looked like? More important, how did he know her? Did her deceased husband owe him money? She prayed not. Even though John had left her secure, she didn't have room in her budget to pay out extra money.<br><br>As if sensing her confusion, Jacob asked, "What can we do for you, Mr. Armstrong?"<br><br>His green eyes met Jacob's. "Well, I suppose you could show me to my room." He turned his attention back on Rebecca. "I'm the Pony Express station keeper that Mr. Bromley told you would be arriving." He walked back to his horse and pulled down a carpetbag from the back of his saddle.<br><br>If John hadn't already signed the contract to use their farm as a home station, Rebecca would have been tempted to call the whole thing off. But the boys needed the extra income and she didn't want them to be forced to leave the farm to find other jobs. If it was in her power she'd keep them together as a family for as long as possible. Now she simply had to trust in the Lord and pray that everything worked out.<br><br>When John had told Rebecca of the Pony Express and how Mr. Bromley, the Pony Express ramrod, would be by to tell them more about what their part in it entailed, Rebecca never dreamed she'd be singlehand-edly dealing with this many changes. Now that Seth Armstrong was here, she felt even more alone. Her farm was to be the home station and her boys Pony Express riders.<br><br>The original plan had been for John to be the one running the station, not a stranger. But once Mr. Bromley learned of John's death, he had told her he'd be sending a station keeper to replace him. She'd suggested Jacob, but the route superintendent feared Jacob's brothers wouldn't listen and obey him like they would someone else, so he'd sent this new man.<br><br>"Mr. Bromley sent you?" Jacob's question was for Seth, but he looked to Rebecca for answers, not the man who had just claimed to be the new boss on the farm. Confusion and hurt laced the depths of his eyes.<br><br>Rebecca's heart sank knowing he wondered why she hadn't told him of this latest development. She nodded. "Yes. Mr. Bromley came out last week when you and the others were fixing fences in the back pasture. When he found out that John had passed, he insisted we needed a station keeper. I planned to tell you and the other boys soon." She hadn't expected the replacement to arrive a week later and had thought she'd have more time to break it gently to Jacob.<br><br>Jacob nodded, but a thin veil of hardness covered his eyes. He turned his gaze back to Seth. "I'll show you where you can put your things."<br><br>Rebecca watched them head to the bunkhouse. She heard Jacob ask, "You got any papers on you? Proving you are who you say you are?" His young voice held strength, a strength she'd leaned on too heavily in the past few months.<br><br>Seth Armstrong chuckled. "Sure have. Right here in my bag. I'll show them to you and Mrs. Young, once I get settled in." He pulled his horse behind him as Jacob led the way to the bunkhouse.<br><br>She turned and looked at the smoldering pile of embers that used to be her barn. Gone. In just a few minutes the barn had burned to the ground. What had Benjamin been doing out here? Especially in the early hours of the morning?<br><br>Rebecca stepped closer to the rubble. She sighed. It looked as if she would have to dip into her funds to rebuild the barn. Jacob would have to ask for credit from the lumber mill and she'd add the nails to her growing tab at the general store. Once they had the total cost of the barn and all the supplies they'd need, she'd get the money from the bank and pay both men. She'd learned shortly after John's death that if she didn't deal with the men in this manner, they'd take advantage of her and she ended up paying more than what she'd actually owed. That wasn't going to happen again.<br><br>As she walked back to the house, Rebecca called to the new Pony Express station keeper and Jacob. "Breakfast will be ready in half an hour. Don't make me wait."<br><br>The desire to call out to Mr. Armstrong to return to where he came from pulled at her vocal cords. She would like nothing more than to have the peace and quiet of her farm restored. But Rebecca knew that wasn't possible. If she wanted to keep her family together, then the Pony Express would have to be a big part of it, and that included Seth Armstrong.<br><br>Seth laid his bag on the bed. Jacob had taken him to the small room off to the left-hand side of the bunk-house. It contained a bed, a side table and a chest with a washbasin on the top. A wooden box hung above the trunk and held a razor and hand mirror. An adjoining door led to the remainder of the bunkhouse, giving him two methods of entry.<br><br>"I'll get my things out of here after breakfast." Jacob stood with his hand on the doorknob.<br><br>Seth hoped his words rang true as he said, "I hate to put you out."<br><br>Jacob shook his head. "The other boys will be more comfortable with me than you in the other room with them."<br><br>"I'm sure they will." Seth took his Bible out of the bag and laid it down on the table.<br><br>Jacob studied the book as if it was a snake. "You read that often?"<br><br>"Every night."<br><br>The boy nodded. "I'll leave you to settle in and go check on the others." He didn't wait for an answer, but simply walked out the door.<br><br>Seth looked down at the worn brown leather of his Bible. It was the same one that his father had preached from and studied over for many hours. Jacob had acted as if it was poisonous, or might inflict harm, instead of being a balm that offered soothing words to a troubled soul. Had he been placed here to help the boy find his way to God? He doubted Jacob would welcome him in that area of his life any more than he welcomed him now as the new Pony Express station keeper.<br><br>He moved to the only window in the bunkhouse and looked out at the burned barn. Smoke still spiraled upward to the sky. Building a new barn would help him get to know the young men who were now his charges. Seth planned on staying just long enough to teach them how to survive the trail they were soon to be riding and then he'd continue on to search for Charlotte, his lost mailorder bride.<br><br>His thoughts went to the woman who had promised to be his bride. The last letter he'd received from her said she was taking the first stage out of California and should arrive in a few weeks, only she'd never showed. After his grandmother's death, Seth had left his home in St. Joseph, Missouri, and begun searching for Charlotte. He was a man of his word and he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother. He'd find Charlotte and marry her. He knew he wouldn't fall in love. His mother had taught him that to love someone meant getting hurt and he'd never go through what his father had. Never.<br><br>He doubted Charlotte had come to any harm. Her letters had indicated she didn't want to get married any more than he did, but the girl had no other choices at the time. She'd been up-front in her reasons for answering his advertisement&#x2014;lack of money and nowhere else to turn. He'd been honest, too, telling her he was trying to keep his last promise to his now-deceased grandmother. He'd also told her he didn't believe in falling in love, as it only led to heartbreak and death. His own mother had deserted him and his father when he was a child. No, he wouldn't open himself up to that kind of hurt again. He'd keep his promise to get married. He'd assured his grandmother he wouldn't be alone after she died and he'd keep that promise, one way or another.<br><br></p><h2>B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs Collection, Vol. 1</h2><p>In 2001, Hellboy quit the B.P.R.D., leaving Abe Sapien to lead Liz Sherman and a bizarre roster of special agents, defending the world from occult threats, including the growing menace of the frog army, first spotted in Hellboy: Seed of Destruction.

Maas.The storm came with little warning. A flash of lightning lit up Clark&#x2019;s glasses as he huddled beneath the Java Depot awning with three former football teammates, all of them watching the sudden deluge pound the streets of downtown Smallville. The whipping rain had forced them elbow to elbow, and if Clark exercised a little amnesia, it almost felt like old times, back when he and the football squad were thick as thieves.<br> He doubted they would ever be close like that again. Not after he had quit on them.<br> Clark had always marveled at the power of thunderstorms, which put even his own mysterious strength into perspective. For others, the storm was nothing more than a nuisance. An older businessman, holding a briefcase over his head, sprinted toward a silver SUV, where he beeped open his door and dove inside. A drenched calico slunk beneath an industrial trash bin, looking for a dry place to wait out the downpour.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just stand here all day,&#x201d; Paul shouted over the roar of the rain. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s make a run for the library.&#x201d;<br> Kyle crossed his arms and rocked back on his heels. &#x201c;Dude, this shit is, like, biblical. I&#x2019;m not going <i>any</i>where.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess we could just do this here.&#x201d; Tommy glanced back at the closed door of the coffee shop before turning to Clark. &#x201c;Cool with you, big guy?&#x201d;<br> Clark shrugged, still wondering what &#x201c;this&#x201d; was. And why no one else could be within earshot.<br> He had been more than a little surprised when Tommy Jones, a lumbering offensive lineman, approached him at school wanting to &#x201c;hang out.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been equally surprised when Tommy then showed up at the coffee shop with star running back Paul Molina and fullback Kyle Turner. After all, they&#x2019;d wanted nothing to do with Clark for the better part of two years&#x2014;since the day he abruptly left the freshman&nbsp; team midseason.<br> Now here they all were, kicking it on Main Street again. Like nothing had ever happened.<br> But Clark knew there had to be a catch.<br> Tommy raised the brim of his baseball cap and cleared his throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing you know our record this past season,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;We sort of . . . underachieved.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one way of putting it,&#x201d; Kyle said, and Paul shook his head in disgust.<br> Clark should have known. This meetup was about football. Because when it came to Tommy, Kyle, and Paul, <i>everything </i>was about football.<br> &#x201c;Anyway, us three have been talking.&#x201d; Tommy slapped a big, meaty hand onto Clark&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all be seniors next year. And we wanna go out with a bang.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>A massive clap of thunder echoed overhead, causing the three football players to flinch. Clark had never understood that reaction. How even the bravest people he knew could get so spooked by a little thunder. It was yet another example of how different he was from his peers. The guys tried to play off their jumpiness by checking their phones and studying their drinks.<br> That&#x2019;s when Clark noticed something odd.<br> About thirty yards to his right, a wire-thin man in his early twenties was standing in the middle of the road, holding out his arms and staring up into the pouring rain. He had a tight buzz cut, and he was dressed head to toe in brown. Brown long-sleeved shirt. Brown pants. Brown combat boots. Clark had an uneasy feeling about the guy.<br> &#x201c;Look at <i>this </i>freak,&#x201d; Paul said, noticing him, too. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br> &#x201c;Over there.&#x201d; Paul pointed, but a slow big rig rumbled by, blocking their view. When it had passed, the man was gone.<br> Paul frowned, scratching the back of his shaved head and scanning the empty street. &#x201c;He was standing out there a second ago. I swear.&#x201d;<br> Clark searched for the man, too. Random strangers dressed in all brown didn&#x2019;t just appear on the streets of Smallville, only to disappear seconds later. Who <i>was </i>he? Clark glanced back through the Java Depot window, where a dozen or so people he recognized were sitting at little round tables, drinking coffee and talking. Doing homework. Taking refuge from the storm.<br> He wondered if any of them had seen the guy.<br> As swiftly as the storm had begun, it now slowed to a quiet sprinkle. Steam rose off a drenched Main Street. Heavy drops fell from the trees. They streaked down the windshields of parked&nbsp;cars and zigzagged down street signs. The road was a sea of puddles.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s walk,&#x201d; Tommy said, and they set off toward the public square, Clark still looking for the man dressed in brown.<br> The four of them had to veer around a series of orange cones blocking off yet another construction zone. A surging local economy had led to a serious transformation of downtown Smallville over the past several years. Gone were all the boarded-up storefronts and dilapidated buildings of Clark&#x2019;s youth. In their place were trendy restaurants, real estate offices, a luxury condo development, and two shiny new bank branches. Multiple construction projects seemed to always be under way now, including the future headquarters for the powerful Mankins Corporation. But there was no work being done this afternoon. The storm had turned Main Street into a ghost town.<br> &#x201c;Look, Clark,&#x201d; Tommy said, attempting to pick up where he&#x2019;d left off, &#x201c;we all know how much better we would be with you in the backfield. I mean, there&#x2019;s a reason we were undefeated in the games you played freshman year.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, before he bailed on us,&#x201d; Paul scoffed.<br> Tommy shot Paul a dirty look. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d we talk about earlier, man? This is about moving forward. It&#x2019;s about second chances.&#x201d;<br> Clark shrank into himself.<br> Two years later and he still couldn&#x2019;t stomach the idea that he&#x2019;d let the team down. And then lied to them. He hadn&#x2019;t quit football to concentrate on school, like he told everyone at the time. He quit because he could have scored on just about every play from scrimmage. And the urge to dominate&#x2014;wrong as it seemed&#x2014;grew stronger with each passing game. Until one day he ran over Miles Loften during a tackling drill, sending him to the hospital with&nbsp;fractured ribs. And Clark had only been going about 50 percent.

And how bad it would be if anyone found out.</p><h2>The Allure Of Men</h2><p>A collection of the most desired, envied, and debonair men in history. From the frock coats of Gainsborough's portraits to city workers' two-piece suits, men and their fashion have made a vital contribution to our collective notion of style. One of France's leading fashion and style specialists, author Fran�ois Baudot juxtaposes paintings and photographs of famous and lesser-known figures dating back almost 200 years, embodying centuries of elegance and style.<br></p><p>In scholarly words and stunning, mostly black-and-white photographs, stylemeister Fran�ois Baudot uses the coffee-table book format to pose an important fashion question: How in the world did the vain modern male give up colorful clothing? As he puts it, "How is it that those 17th century birds of paradise ... turned themselves into jet-black crows?" Baudot says it was the Sun King's fault. Louis XIV, mad for frills and flounces, made everybody who was anybody in France circa 1650 wear billowing shirts with lacy sleeves, plumed hats, polychrome silk stockings, "breeches so voluminous that they made walking a problem," high-heeled shoes, "their bows shaped like a windmill's sails," garters, ribbons, makeup, rings, and miserably hot, outrageously expensive wigs. Louis made fashion "lose all contact with reality." <p> What could possibly come next? Revolution! "The Louis XIV effect was not to be reproduced.... Thenceforth, in his dress, modern man could now only proceed by way of successively and irreversibly discarding things." </p><p> This sounds like a lot of French philosophical jive, but the photos Baudot adduces of fashion-plate men--movie stars, politicos, artists, and anonymous guys--do bear him out. Compare, say, the intricately embroidered getup of the Nawab of Bahawalpur in India, or T. Philips's renowned painting of that mad dandy, Lord Byron, with the book's main procession of men in customary suits of solemn black. England's Prince Philip, looking imperially slim in 1950s London, has much the same stylistic allure as James Joyce posed in his most famous picture in Paris in the 1920s. Mao and de Gaulle evoke similar auras of scary power precisely by renouncing outward sumptuousness for authoritative sartorial abstemiousness. Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart, Errol Flynn, Fred Astaire, JFK and Bobby, Prince William at Eton, even fatally flamboyant Jean-Michel Basquiat in the full flower of fame--these men resemble so many distinguished penguins. Even the naked men in the book--Sudanese Nuba tribesmen circa 1949 and Yves Saint Laurent launching his "Y pour homme" perfume in 1971--can be seen in terms of the male expression of power by emphatic understatement in dress. </p><p> Ultimately, it's tough to sum up Baudot's thesis. But the man sure knows how to pick cool photographs. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Masculine elegance, so flamboyant and colorful up until the end of the 18th century, became almost non-existant in the 19th century. From the frock coats of Gainsborough's portraits to the city workers' two-piece suits, the structure of men's clothes evolved at a slow pace. But the language of this uniformity has subtly varied in its details, in the cut, proportion or materials of a piece of clothing. Though individually these different elements are almost imperceptible, each is resolutely identifiable, and each makes a vital contribution to the even more intangible notion of style.<p>This book juxtaposes paintings and photographs of movie stars, politicians, artists, or lesser-known figures dating over almost two centuries, whose very different silhouettes, when placed alongside one another, encapsulate a certain idea of modern elegance and its concern with style.</p></p><h2>Four-Stroke Motocross and Off-Road Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p><p></p>This thorough how-to manual helps the off-road motorcycle enthusiast get the most out of their machine.

Yet most of what is commonly believed about that fateful night in 1912 is, at best, a body of myth and legend nurtured by the ship's owners and surviving officers and kept alive by generations of authors and moviemakers. That, at least, is the thesis presented in this compellingly bold, thoroughly plausible contrarian reconstruction of the last hours of the pride of the White Star Line. </p><p>The new but no-less harrowing <i>Titanic</i> story that Captain David G. Brown unfolds is one involving a tragic chain of errors on the part of the well-meaning crew, the pernicious influence of the ship's haughty owner, who was aboard for the maiden trip, and a fatal overconfidence in the infallibility of early twentieth-century technology. Among the most startling facts to emerge are that the <i>Titanic</i> did not collide with an iceberg but instead ran aground on a submerged ice shelf, resulting in damage not to the ship's sides but to the bottom of her hull. First Officer Murdoch never gave the infamous CRASH STOP ("reverse engines") order; rather, he ordered ALL STOP, allowing him to execute a nearly successful S-curve maneuver <i>around</i> the berg. The iceberg did not materialize unheralded from an ice-free sea; the <i>Titanic</i> was likely steaming at 22 1/2 knots through scattered ice, with no extra lookouts posted, for two hours or more before the fatal encounter. Visibility was not poor that night, and the only signs of haze or distortion were those produced by the ice field itself as the <i>Titanic</i> approached. Most startling of all, however, is evidence that the ship might have stayed afloat long enough to permit the rescue of all passengers and crew if Captain Smith, at the behest of his employer, Bruce Ismay, had not given the order to resume steaming. </p><p>Offering a radically new interpretation of the facts surrounding the most famous shipwreck in history, <i>The Last Log of the</i> Titanic is certain to ignite a storm of controversy.</p></p><p><p>"Absolutely fascinating--it fills a huge void in the literature of the subject. . . . Brown's familiarity with the technical aspects of shipdriving, based on his own career at sea, gives him enormous credibility. . . . <i>The Last Log of the</i> Titanic has more surprises than any book I've seen on the topic in the past 23 years."--Thomas C. Wingfield, Lieutenant Commander, U.S. Naval Reserve </p><p>A ship's logbook is like an airplane's "black box" in which all the specifics of a voyage are entered--the full nautical record of the journey. Imagine how fascinating the log entries from the <i>Titanic</i>'s last hours would be. Of course, the actual log of the <i>Titanic</i> went to the bottom with the ship and has never been recovered. <i>The Last Log of the</i> Titanic, the first <i>Titanic</i> book written from the perspective of an expert ship handler, subjects the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> to the brand of professional analysis that until now has been conspicuously missing from the literature of the great liner. Captain David G. Brown reconstructs the events leading up to the disaster, working from eyewitness accounts. He meticulously examines the official testimony given before the U.S. Senate and the British Board of Trade, as well as original newspaper accounts, allowing logic and the rigorous standards of good seamanship, rather than bias and tradition, to reveal the facts of the case. In the process he exposes the many false assumptions, obfuscations, and outrights lies that were propagated by surviving crewmembers and passengers, and by White Star officials, as he unearths long-buried truths.</p><b>David G.

Why?</p> <p>Making Music was written both to answer this question and to offer ways to make it easier. It presents a systematic, concrete set of patterns that you can use when making music in order to move forward. There are already many ways-books, classes, video tutorials, software documentation, private teachers-to learn about music technology and music production. But almost all of them focus on the second half of the equation-technology or production- rather than the first half: music.</p> <p>Making Music is an attempt to help people who are comfortable with the basics of music production at a technical level but who still find music-making to be a difficult process (which I suspect is all of us!). This book will not teach you how to use a compressor, program a synthesizer, or make a great-sounding kick drum. Those aspects of music-making are already well covered. What it will teach you is how to make music using those tools, with a specific emphasis on solving musical problems, making progress, and (most importantly) finishing what you start.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Whole New Light</h2><p>From the heat of an Acapulco night...<br><br>Cyn McCall knew she could always count on her late husband's friend and business partner, Worth Lansing.

This plot, with its twists and turns, offers little resolution or development. Moving at a frenetic pace, the story is disorienting and unorganized; comic strips that have little relevance to the story appear between many of the chapters and interrupt the flow of the narrative. Still, the goth-styled characters and vampire themes have appeal, and teens with interest in these areas will naturally gravitate toward this book.<i>&#x2013;Jennifer Feigelman, Goshen Public Library and Historical Society, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The kitchen clock read 6:45 A.M.</p><p>&#x201c;Ready, shipmate?&#x201d; she called.</p><p>A <i>meow</i> answered her from the living room.</p><p>Liz was dressed for work: a dark blue shirt and matching pants with the cuffs tucked into black boots. The name over her shirt pocket read <i>KIDD</i> in black letters. At fifty, she was trim and lean, a runner who worked to keep herself fit, something she was finding more difficult as the years rolled on. Still, she didn&#x2019;t suffer from the loose skin at the throat&#x2014;<i>turkey neck</i>, people called it&#x2014;many women her age developed. She was toned, her skin weathered by sun and elements, with deepening crow&#x2019;s-feet at the corners of her eyes. Those eyes were dark and clear and, other than reading glasses, required no correction. Liz looked forward to passing her annual physical fitness qualifications with ease.</p><p>She pulled a dark blue baseball cap down over a bristle of short hair the color of steel. Most people, she knew, assumed that she didn&#x2019;t care for having men in her personal life. The hair, her profession, the absence of a husband, and even the cat contributed to the stereotype. Those people were wrong, and she had even been married briefly, it just hadn&#x2019;t worked. She had a spouse nonetheless, an incredibly demanding one, and to which she was utterly devoted.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said, crouching in front of a pet carrier and sticking her fingers through the grille. &#x201c;Ready to go for a ride? You need to be a good boy while Mommy&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><p>A black-and-gray-striped cat pushed its head against the fingers and meowed.</p><p>Liz slung a black nylon laptop bag across her chest, then picked up a heavy blue sea bag in one hand and the cat carrier in the other. Outside, she set her load down long enough to lock the front door, and then put her gear into a dark gray Camry. The cat carrier went onto the passenger seat, where she strapped it in tightly with the seat belt&#x2019;s shoulder harness.</p><p>She loved this town, and had lived here three different times in nearly thirty years, and it would be where she retired. Her tidy little house with its immaculate lawn sat in the suburbs of Rainier Valley, south of Seattle. Bright blue skies and clouds still tinged pink from the sunrise soared overhead. Though she didn&#x2019;t yet know it, the world was already ending this glorious summer morning, and she would never see her little house again.</p><p>Liz backed into the street and in her side mirror saw one of her neighbors, a young woman, out for a morning jog along the sidewalk. At the house next door, Mr. Fulton, in pajamas, a robe, and bare feet, lurched down his driveway toward his morning paper. The man suffered from both gout and a heart condition, and the way he moved told Liz he was having a particularly difficult morning. Liz threw them both a wave&#x2014;the jogger returned it, Mr. Fulton did not, as he was a consummate grump&#x2014;and pulled away, headed to work.</p><p>She had already turned the corner and so couldn&#x2019;t see the jogger and Mr. Fulton reach the end of the old man&#x2019;s driveway at the same time. She also didn&#x2019;t see Mr. Fulton wrestle the jogger to the ground, rip out her throat with fingernails and teeth, and begin to feed.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>As the Camry made its way west, winding out of residential neighborhoods and heading toward the more built-up section of the city near the water, the cat in the carrier beside her settled in and quieted. He was used to this routine. Liz wished she could take him with her, but that just wasn&#x2019;t possible.</p><p>She would have preferred leaving him home where he was comfortable, but that wasn&#x2019;t possible either. Chick, who lived in the small basement apartment of her little house, wouldn&#x2019;t feed him. He wouldn&#x2019;t water plants or do yard work, either, and she had to employ a landscaping company to keep her lawn and shrubs squared away during her prolonged absences.</p><p>No, Charlie &#x201c;Chick&#x201d; Kidd wasn&#x2019;t one for domestic responsibility. But he was her brother, her only sibling, and despite his many flaws she loved him and was happy he had accepted her offer to share the house. Chick was coming home today after being out for three weeks, and though her own job would keep her extremely busy, she hoped they could make time to see each other for dinner before she had to leave.</p><p>The lights and blare of a siren came on fast as an ambulance raced toward her. Liz pulled quickly to the shoulder, and as the vehicle passed, a string of unhappy yowls came from the cat carrier.</p><p>&#x201c;Steady,&#x201d; Liz said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s just a medic.&#x201d;</p><p>Before she could pull back into the road, a squad car appeared, screaming after the emergency medical vehicle. The cat was not pleased, and let her know it. Liz reached across and put her fingers through the grille of the cat carrier. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, kitty, Mommy&#x2019;s right here.&#x201d; The cat ignored the fingers and made a noise that was more groan than meow.</p><p>The quickest way to work at this early hour would have taken her up onto I-5 near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. As she approached, however, she saw the flashing blue and red lights of police and fire vehicles, so many that it indicated a major accident. A river of stopped motorists was stacked up behind it with car doors standing open and people moving slowly through the traffic jam. Liz bypassed the on-ramp before she could become stuck herself and took an alternate route. She cut left, then right, and passed under the freeway, traveling across the industrial district before turning north on Route 99, also called Alaskan Way. She could follow it all the way to work, and the many traffic lights were still preferable to sitting still for who knew how long while the accident was cleared.</p><p>The day was bright and clear, a contradiction to what most people believed about Seattle: that it poured every day. The heaviest precipitation ran from November to January, and although it was usually cloudy and did experience frequent mist and light rain, August was typically warm and dry, just like today. In her rearview mirror, Mount Rainier&#x2014;simply called The Mountain by locals&#x2014;dominated the southeastern horizon. Through her windshield, Seattle&#x2019;s skyline rose with the iconic Space Needle standing against a bright blue background. It was a beautiful day to be a Seattleite.</p><p>She continued north, passing the Pacific Maritime Institute on her left. A block farther on, she slowed and came to a stop behind several cars lined up behind a tractor-trailer standing in the road. Its emergency flashers were blinking, and the cab&#x2019;s driver door stood open. After a few moments the cars ahead of her eased around it and continued on their way. Liz did the same, and as she passed she saw the cab was empty, the driver nowhere in sight.</p><p>&#x201c;Hell of a place to break down,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The cat meowed its agreement.</p><p>She arrived at her turn and made a left. The view ahead made her catch her breath and smile. There it was, <i>Joshua James</i>, its snowy white hull brilliant in the morning light, black masts and antennae towering above. Although it had yet to receive its markings and have the big 754 painted on its bow, the vessel was more beautiful than any she had ever seen. It would be her last sea command, and what a way to finish a nearly thirty-year career of serving aboard cutters. There was still some debate about whether the ship would remain here in Seattle after commissioning or report to a new home in Charleston, South Carolina. Certainly Liz preferred it remain here, but she wouldn&#x2019;t complain about relocating to Charleston for a few years. She wasn&#x2019;t part of the decision-making process; the Coast Guard would cut her orders, and she would report wherever they sent her without complaint.</p><p>Liz slowed as she reached the base gate and a young man armed and wearing camouflage stepped out of the gatehouse with a clipboard. The striped barrier was down and a red and white sign set in the clipped grass off to the right read <i>MARSEC LEVEL 1</i>&#x2014;out of three&#x2014;with the words <i>SIGNIFICANT RISK</i> beneath it. The sign had displayed this message for some time as a response to recent threats from foreign terrorist groups. Guarding against those threats was, to a great extent, Liz&#x2019;s responsibility, and the reason <i>Joshua James</i> and her sister ships had been built.</p><p>As Liz brought the Camry to a stop and rolled down her window, the sentry looked at the base pass in the windshield, checked his clipboard, then snapped off a crisp salute. &#x201c;Good morning, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Petty Officer,&#x201d; she said, giving him a nod. When the sentry stooped to look inside the vehicle, Liz patted the pet carrier. &#x201c;House cat, one each,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The sentry allowed a trace of a smile and looked again at his clipboard. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I have orders to direct you to the base commander&#x2019;s office immediately upon your arrival.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; she said, and the sentry saluted again as the barrier rose and the Camry pulled through. He watched her car for a moment, then stepped back into the guardhouse and picked up the phone.</p><p>Half an hour later, the young sentry squinted at something out in the road in front of the guardhouse. He lifted a pair of binoculars for a closer look.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; he whispered, reaching for the phone again.</p><p>Every line was already lit.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Liz parked the Camry in a visitor&#x2019;s space in front of the base administration building, then grabbed the cat carrier from the front seat. On the way up the steps, she returned the salutes of two enlisted men exiting the building. Once inside, she immediately tucked her ball cap into a cargo pocket and headed up the main corridor, boots thumping the tile in a measured cadence, the pet carrier hanging in her left hand.</p><p>Down another corridor she stopped before a door with <i>James Whelan, Rear Admiral</i> stenciled in black letters on frosted glass. She smoothed her uniform blouse and went in. Beverly, the base commander&#x2019;s secretary, was at her desk in the outer office.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Liz,&#x201d; the woman said brightly. She was a few years younger than Liz, thicker and wearing a yellow dress, eyeglasses hung around her neck on a chain. &#x201c;I see you brought a friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Liz set the pet carrier down on a chair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to leave Blackbeard with Dottie Carr over at the Base Exchange to watch him while I&#x2019;m out. Is it okay if I leave him with you while I talk to the skipper?&#x201d; She jerked a thumb at the door to the inner office.</p><p>The secretary smiled. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s no trouble at all,&#x201d; she said, coming around the desk and crouching in front of the pet carrier. &#x201c;Are you, Blackbeard?&#x201d;</p><p>The cat began to purr and rub his head against the grille. He knew Beverly.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re waiting for you,&#x201d; Beverly said, rising.</p><p>Liz frowned. &#x201c;Who is <i>they</i>? It&#x2019;s not just Whelan?&#x201d;</p><p>Beverly shook her head. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know there was a meeting?&#x201d; She seemed flustered. &#x201c;I just assumed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Liz gave her a smile. &#x201c;Not to worry, Bev.&#x201d; She rapped hard on the door frame twice, then let herself in.</p><p>The office of Base Seattle&#x2019;s ranking officer was carpeted and done in rich, dark wood paneling and bookcases. The admiral&#x2019;s desk sat before blinds that were mostly closed and was flanked by the American flag on one side and the Coast Guard colors, known as the Service Mark, on the other. Photos, awards, and framed certificates covered the walls. A conference table lined with padded leather chairs dominated the room. Liz caught the scent of the admiral&#x2019;s aftershave at once. <i>Too much Old Spice.</i> His grandchildren insisted on giving it to him every Christmas, he had once told her.</p><p>The admiral rose from his desk as she entered. He was thickening around the middle, wearing a light blue tropical uniform shirt, the breast heavy with ribbons, and he smiled when he saw her, but Liz noticed at once that it was forced. Standing near the conference table, a stack of manila file folders on the polished surface before them, were a male Coast Guard officer and a thirty-something woman in a tailored gray business suit.</p><p>Liz came to attention. &#x201c;Captain Elizabeth Kidd, reporting as ordered.&#x201d;</p><p>The admiral came from behind the desk and shook her hand. His grip and his eyes were warm, but he looked tired. &#x201c;Good to see you, Liz.&#x201d; He put a hand on her shoulder and gently turned her to face the two others, who had stopped talking and now stared at her.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Lieutenant Commander Chamberlain of Coast Guard Investigation Services,&#x201d; the admiral said, &#x201c;and this is Special Agent Ramsey of the FBI&#x2019;s Seattle field office.&#x201d;</p><p>The visitors did not offer to shake hands.</p><p>Liz&#x2019;s radar was up, and the lines around her mouth deepened. The two investigators appeared to be waiting for Liz to ask, <i>What&#x2019;s this all about?</i> She hadn&#x2019;t risen to command by being predictable, and remained quiet.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a seat.&#x201d; Admiral Whelan took the chair at the head of the table and gestured for Liz to sit beside him. The two investigators sat down across from her.</p><p>Whelan cleared his throat. &#x201c;Liz, Lieutenant Commander Chamberlain and Agent Ramsey are here because of a situation involving Charlie. This is going to be difficult, but I trust in your professionalism and will expect your cooperation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chick?&#x201d; Liz said, looking at her superior officer. &#x201c;What happened? Is he all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Whelan nodded, and then the Coast Guard investigator started. &#x201c;Captain Kidd&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He smiled and shook his head. &#x201c;Captain, is it true you&#x2019;re a blood descendant of the famous pirate?&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth knew this was simply the young man&#x2019;s attempt to break the ice and establish rapport. She had no shame about her ancestor, quite the opposite, actually, but it was the smirk she didn&#x2019;t care for. It put an edge on her voice. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t really come here to discuss my lineage, did you, Mr. Chamberlain? Do you have some official business?&#x201d;</p><p>The young man reddened.</p><p>Agent Ramsey took over, her voice clipped and businesslike. &#x201c;Captain, I&#x2019;m going to explain some details to you that might help move this conversation forward. At first, they will seem quite sensitive. The facts are not in dispute, however, and the case is bulletproof. We would not have come to you at this point were that not the case.&#x201d; She folded her hands on the table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be candid with you out of respect for your service to this country, and in the hope you will in turn provide full disclosure.&#x201d;</p><p>The FBI agent rested her hand on a file as she spoke, not opening it. She knew the case well. &#x201c;Your brother, Senior Chief Charles Kidd, is the suspect in a joint FBI, DEA, and Coast Guard investigation involving drug trafficking and multiple homicides. His ship just arrived at the base, and he is being taken into custody as we speak.&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth stared at the female agent, stunned by the allegations and unable to speak. Admiral Whelan reached out and gripped her arm for reassurance.</p><p>&#x201c;Our evidence,&#x201d; the agent continued, &#x201c;establishes that on June twenty-seventh of t...</p></p><h2>Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders (Princeton Legacy Library, 1794)</h2><p><p>Modern international business has its origins in the overseas trade of the Middle Ages. Of the various communities active in trade in the Islamic countries at that time, records of only the Jewish community survive. Thousands of documents were preserved in the Cairo Geniza, a lumber room attached to the synagogue where discarded writings containing the name of God were deposited to preserve them from desecration. From them Professor Goitein has selected eighty letters that provide a fascinating glimpse into the world of the medieval Jewish traders.</p><p> As the letters vividly illustrate, international trade depended on a network of personal relationships and mutual confidence. Organization was largely through partnerships, based usually on ties of common religion but often reinforced by family connections. Sometimes the partners of Jews were Christians or Muslims, and the letters show these merchants working together in greater harmony than has been thought, even in partnerships that lasted through generations. The services rendered to a friend or partner and those expected from him were great, and the book opens with an angry letter from a merchant who believed he had been let down by his friend.</p><p>The life of a trader was full of dangers, as the letter describing a shipwreck illustrates, and put great strain on personal relationships. One of the most moving letters is that written to his wife by a man absent in India for many years while endeavoring to make the family's fortunes. Although never ceasing to love her and longing to be with her, he offers to divorce her if she feels she can wait for him no longer. A decisive event in the life of the great Jewish philosopher, Moses Maimonides, was the death of his brother David, who drowned in the Indian Ocean. Printed here is the last letter David wrote, describing his safe crossing of the desert and announcing his intention to go on to India, against his brother's instructions.</p><p> Professor Goitein has provided an introduction and notes for each letter, and a general introduction describing the social and spiritual world of the writers, the organization of overseas trade in the Middle Ages, and the goods traded. The letters demonstrate that although it reached from Spain to India, the traders' world was a cohesive one through which these men could move freely and always feel at home.</p><p>Originally published in 1974.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Even on the personal level each person must confront the curves life throws his or her way. Buddhism has a great deal to say about change and impermanence and how to meaningfully deal with it. Change--whether on a large or small scale--provides our most important opportunity for learning about ourselves and the nature of reality. From this essential insight Lama Surya Das has crafted a fulfilling and important path to understanding and healing ourselves and finding peace.<br><br>Full of personal stories, anecdotes, practical exercises, guided meditations and reflections, and pithy original aphorisms, <i>Letting Go of the Person You Used to Be</i> addresses life's most universal difficulties in a way that is accessible to all. By using memorable concepts such as The Virtues of Adversity, The Pearl Principle ("No inner irritation, no pearl"), and Gaining through Loss, Surya reminds readers that hiding from change and loss is futile. Learning to consciously accept and embrace change leads to a better understanding of ourselves and our own innate divine light.</p><p>&#x201c;During these challenging times when fear and self-doubt become our constant companions this beautiful book provides the guidance we all need to use change and loss as a catalyst for our spiritual evolution.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Cheryl Richardson<i>, New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Take Time for Your Life<br></i><br>&#x201c;It is inevitably painful to deal with transition, change, suffering, death, and other losses.&nbsp; They are realities we would prefer to avoid, or minimize, but they are essentially part of life.&nbsp; We must face them with courage, grace, clarity and wisdom.&nbsp; Lama Surya Das teaches us how to do so in the spirit of enlightenment, great practical wisdom, humility and effective compassion.&nbsp; <i>Letting Go of the Person You Used to Be</i> is a further tribute to his masterful talents as a spiritual teacher.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;</b>Wayne Teasdale, author of<i> The Mystic Heart<br></i><br>Praise for the landmark Awakening Trilogy by Lama Surya Das<br><br><i>Awakening the Buddha Within<br></i><br>&#x201c;Lama Surya Das communicates the wisdom of Buddhism to the people of his times and environments.

Pausing fifty feet from the entrance, the Alpha strike trio, with veteran commander and Medal of Honor winner Captain David Brentwood on point, checked out the closet-sized opening through the thermal sights of their Heckler &amp; Koch flame- and sound-suppressed machine guns. Bravo, the backup squad of four commandos, was comprised of Eddie Merton, armed with the team&#x2019;s Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), two men carrying M-4 carbines, and Jamal &#x201c;Jam&#x201d; Hassim, the only Muslim-American in the team, toting a shotgun. The seven-man team of Alpha and Bravo waited two minutes, an eternity in the gritty, dust-smelling darkness. Radiant heat seeping from the cave showed up as white splotches against the emerald green of the commandos&#x2019; night vision goggles, as did the infrared ID tape on their helmets, sleeves, and ankles.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no sign of guards. The seven men waited until they were sure that no one in the area had been unduly aroused by the sound of the Pave Low; that any al Qaeda present would, it was hoped, dismiss it as yet another of the Allied helos that periodically skirted the towering peaks of the Hindu Kush, flying westward through the Khyber Pass into Kapisa Province and on to the armor-friendly plains north of Kabul. Even in the icy wind chill, several of the commandos were sweating beneath the weight of their mission-specific gear, which included ammo load/assault vest packs, flash bang grenades, additional mags, flashlight pouch, camelback water bladder, night vision goggles, black Nomex gloves, balaclava, Beretta 9mm sidearms, and the beloved miscellaneous gadget bags attached to each man&#x2019;s load vest.<br> &nbsp;<br> Satisfied there was no movement nearby, six of the seven-man team&#x2014;three on either side&#x2014;entered the cave. The seventh man, Eddie Merton, armed with the SAW and responsible for operating the team&#x2019;s HF radio, SATCOM unit, and cell phone, took up position as planned at the entrance to the cave. Thermal Satscans, in satellite overflights, had shown that the entry widened immediately beyond its opening, snaking its way for four hundred feet into the rock below a razorback ridge. As the two three-man squads moved cautiously forward in the cave, Eddie placed his SAW against a two-foot-high rock by the entrance and popped his &#x201c;baby umbrella&#x201d;&#x2014;the black double crisscross SATCOM antenna. He then took cover behind the boulder, from where he could best serve as the DA team&#x2019;s rear guard during the snatch and grab. For a while, at least, he could maintain communications with Brentwood and the other five, each equipped with Saver FM radio and earphone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the cave, the air was damp, sour, the rock floor strewn with thousands of marble-sized pebbles blown in throughout the ages by the fiercely frigid winds that swirled through the mountain fastness of the Hindu Kush. Despite the weight of their packs, the commandos&#x2019; footsteps were all but silenced by the U.S. Special Forces&#x2019; state-of-the-art overboots. Made of black, oil-impregnated leather, Spandex, and slow-recovery foam, they muffled the sound of the commandos&#x2019; approach. David Brentwood knew that soon there would be no reliable radio contact with Merton because of the serpentine nature of the cave. He glanced at his watch and whispered into his throat mike. They had been down for three minutes. &#x201c;Exfil 0230.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Exfil 0230,&#x201d; confirmed Merton. It meant they had exactly twenty-seven minutes before the Pave Low returned to exfiltrate the team. Now that the ambient starlight that had been boosted over three million times by their night vision goggles was no longer available, the green monochrome faded, and the Direct Action Team switched on the tiny infrared light at the front of the helmet-mounted monocular unit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Coming to a dogleg where the cave suddenly narrowed, Bravo held back so as not to crowd Brentwood&#x2019;s strike trio, whose sole purpose was to find Li Kuan&#x2014;if he was there. A former and corrupt middle manager from NORINCO, the Chinese government&#x2019;s arms export company, Kuan&#x2019;s sole purpose was to sell Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s successors depleted uranium for a dirty anti-Satan bomb, a conventionally exploded nuclear waste device that would spew out deadly uranium dust over the terrorist&#x2019;s American city of choice. Li Kuan, the commandoes had been told, should be easily identifiable from a pockmarked scalp, reportedly the result of a sulfuric acid-tube timer for a nitrate bomb that had prematurely exploded when he was instructing his al Qaeda clients.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, Brentwood had been one of the thirty-eight Americans who&#x2019;d had the misfortune of witnessing both the nitrate bomb explosion in Oklahoma City in 1995 and, on furlough in New York City in 2001, the first of the 9/11 hits on the World Trade Center. His sister&#x2019;s husband, a bosom buddy, had been one of the scores of firefighters cremated alive when the South Tower imploded. And Jam Hassim had lost a cousin, a U.S. Army sergeant, in the attack on the Pentagon. Knowing this, General Oakley, of Special Operations Command, told David&#x2019;s team that their anger was &#x201c;a good motivator. But remember,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d added, &#x201c;the mission isn&#x2019;t to waste this prick Li. It&#x2019;s to snatch him, bring him back so Intel can have a &#x2019;quiet&#x2019; word with the bastard. The Chinese say he&#x2019;s also trying to sell his dirty bomb stuff to terrorists in the province of Xinjiang. So you&#x2019;ll save a lot more people if we get him alive. Understood?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They had, and they&#x2019;d studied the computer-enhanced photo of Li that Beijing had sent, the only one available. It seemed to them, however, that, aside from the pockmarked bald head, the face was so indistinguishable, it could have belonged to any one of a billion Asians or Eurasians. The team had completed their refresher &#x201c;run-throughs&#x201d; at Delta Force&#x2019;s &#x201c;killing house&#x201d; at Special Operations facilities at Fort Bragg, where they had also undergone&#x2014;no, survived, Brentwood would have said&#x2014;the forty-meter inverted crawl in twenty-five seconds; the thirty-three pushups in a minute; the grueling two-mile, seventeen-minute runs in full gear; and the &#x201c;lovely&#x201d; hundred-meter swim while fully clothed and in assault boots. Only then would they have met the exacting standards laid down for them by the legendary, now retired, General Douglas Freeman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only thirty feet into the cave, Brentwood paused, sensing movement, his hand signals taking over the job of whispered throat mike instructions. Rats scuttled left and right, the stench of the cave now laced with the odor of roasting goat. Jam Hassim could feel warm eddies of air gently brushing the sliver of exposed skin between his NVGs and balaclava. But as yet there was no wood or charcoal odor, no whiff of kerosene, and no white splotch in the NVGs that would indicate the source of the warmth. Perhaps the eddies he&#x2019;d felt were body heat, Hassim thought. But whose?<br> &nbsp;<br> The team was trained for speed and daring, but, when needed, caution&#x2014;all seven commandos were alert for booby traps. He motioned the team forward. They had been down from the Pave Low for only eight minutes. Nineteen to go, and lots to do. Satisfied that the only noise he&#x2019;d heard was that of the rodents, he checked his watch. After ten paces, though, he thought he heard voices, faint, maybe twenty feet farther in, and signaled the men to stop.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Prayers for the Servants of God</h2><p>Original prayers to make times of service sacred.

For the protagonist of this peerlessly observant first novel is Sayuri, one of Japan's most celebrated geisha, a woman who is both performer and courtesan, slave and goddess.<br><br>We follow Sayuri from her childhood in an impoverished fishing village, where in 1929, she is sold to a representative of a geisha house, who is drawn by the child's unusual blue-grey eyes. From there she is taken to Gion, the pleasure district of Kyoto. She is nine years old. In the years that follow, as she works to pay back the price of her purchase, Sayuri will be schooled in music and dance, learn to apply the geisha's elaborate makeup, wear elaborate kimono, and care for a coiffure so fragile that it requires a special pillow. She will also acquire a magnanimous tutor and a venomous rival. Surviving the intrigues of her trade and the upheavals of war, the resourceful Sayuri is a romantic heroine on the order of Jane Eyre and Scarlett O'Hara. And <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i> is a triumphant work - suspenseful, and utterly persuasive.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>According to Arthur Golden's absorbing first novel, the word "geisha" does not mean "prostitute," as Westerners ignorantly assume--it means "artisan" or "artist." To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction, Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music, dance, clever conversation, crafty battle with rival beauties, and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons. After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia--and an M.A. in English--he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha. This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture, chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki, who spent years charming the very rich and famous.<p> The result is a novel with the broad social canvas (and love of coincidence) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering. Readers experience the entire life of a geisha, from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her <i>mizuage</i> (virginity) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams. We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western "trophy wife" than to a prostitute--and, as in Austen, flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman's alternative to the repressive, arcane system of courtship. In simple, elegant prose, Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism, a too-revealing (or not revealing enough) glimpse of flesh under the kimono, or a vicious rumor spread by a rival "as cruel as a spider." </p><p> Golden's web is finely woven, but his book has a serious flaw: the geisha's true romance rings hollow--the love of her life is a symbol, not a character. Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn, but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity--the plight all geisha share. Still, Golden has won the triple crown of fiction: he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid, now-vanished world, and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.</p>"Wonderful, involving, intelligent, fascinating, and almost Dickensian in the way the characters inhabit the landscape, and the landscape permeates the characters. It's a unique, beautifully written book."<br>--Ann Beattie<br><br>"I still can't quite believe that an American male can so seamlessly enter the soul of a Japanese woman, and catch her world, its textures, its hopes, and its sinuous patter with such perfection. Memoirs of a Geisha evokes all the delicate steel of Kyoto's geisha culture with such uncanny fidelity that, after you've finished, you feel as if you've entered not just another world, but an extraordinary and foreign heart."<br>--Pico Iyer<br><br>"Sayuri tells her story with such gentle courtesy and determination that you are quickly brought under the spell of her character. She takes you by the hand and leads you into a world that is both formal and intimate, a world that I had only before glimpsed in the fleeting and beautiful images of traditional Japanese ink painting...Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderful achievement."<br>--Julia Blackburn<br><br>"A haunting tale of a hidden world that could hold an audience spellbound through many an evening in a lantern-lit teahouse."<br>--Geraldine Brooks<br><br>"Memoirs of a Geisha is a masterpiece.

In 1819, the Essex left Nantucket for the South Pacific with twenty crew members aboard. In the middle of the South Pacific the ship was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. The crew drifted for more than ninety days in three tiny whaleboats, succumbing to weather, hunger, disease, and ultimately turning to drastic measures in the fight for survival. Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents-including a long-lost account written by the ship's cabin boy-and penetrating details about whaling and the Nantucket community to reveal the chilling events surrounding this epic maritime disaster. An intense and mesmerizing read, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is a monumental work of history forever placing the Essex tragedy in the American historical canon.</p><p>The appeal of Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> was, in part, that it illuminated a little-known piece of history through a series of captivating incidents and engaging personalities. Nathaniel Philbrick's <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is certainly cast from the same mold, examining the 19th-century Pacific whaling industry through the arc of the sinking of the whaleship <i>Essex</i> by a boisterous sperm whale. The story that inspired Herman Melville's classic <i>Moby-Dick</i> has a lot going for it--derring-do, cannibalism, rescue--and Philbrick proves an amiable and well-informed narrator, providing both context and detail. We learn about the importance and mechanics of blubber production--a vital source of oil--and we get the nuts and bolts of harpooning and life aboard whalers. We are spared neither the nitty-gritty of open boats nor the sucking of human bones dry. <p> By sticking to the tried and tested <i>Longitude</i> formula, Philbrick has missed a slight trick or two. The epicenter of the whaling industry was Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod; most of the whales were in the Pacific, necessitating a huge journey around the southernmost tip of South America. We never learn why no one ever tried to create an alternative whaling capital somewhere nearer. Similarly, Philbrick tells us that the story of the <i>Essex</i> was well known to Americans for decades, but he never explores how such legends fade from our consciousness. Philbrick would no doubt reply that such questions were beyond his remit, and you can't exactly accuse him of skimping on his research. By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly. He doesn't get bogged down in turgid detail, and his narrative rattles along at a nice pace. When the storyline is as good as this, you can't really ask for more. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Stairs and Whispers: D/Deaf and Disabled Poets Write Back</h2><p>Five years after the seminal U.S. anthology, Beauty is a Verb, Nine Arches Press is proud to publish this innovative and boundary breaking anthology.

He argues that, contrary to accepted belief, the members of the group, who fled oppression in Nazi Germany in 1934, had a major influence on postwar intellectual life.</p><p>Members of the Frankfurt School have had an enormous effect on Western thought, beginning soon after Max Horkheimer became the director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt am Main, in 1930. Also known as the Horkheimer Circle, the group included such eminent intellectuals as Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Leo Lowenthal, and Friedrich Pollock. Fleeing Nazi oppression, Horkheimer moved the Institute and many of its affiliated scholars to Columbia University in 1934, where it remained until 1950. <br><br>Until now, the conventional portrayal of the Institute has held that its members found refuge by relocating to Columbia but that they had little contact with, or impact on, American intellectual life. With insight and clarity, Thomas Wheatland demonstrates that the standard account is wrong. Based on deep archival research in Germany and in the United States, and on interviews conducted with luminaries such as Daniel Bell, Bernadine Dohrn, Peter Gay, Todd Gitlin, Nathan Glazer, Tom Hayden, Robert Merton, and others, Wheatland skillfully traces the profound connections between the Horkheimer Circle&#x2019;s members and the intellectual life of the era. Reassessing the group&#x2019;s involvement with the American New Left in the 1960s, he argues that Herbert Marcuse&#x2019;s role was misunderstood in shaping the radical student movement&#x2019;s agenda. More broadly, he illustrates how the Circle influenced American social thought and made an even more dramatic impression on German postwar sociology.<br><br>Although much has been written about the Frankfurt School, this is the first book to closely examine the relationship between its members and their American contemporaries. <i>The Frankfurt School in Exile</i> uncovers an important but neglected dimension of the history of the Frankfurt School and adds immeasurably to our understanding of the contributions made by its �migr� intellectuals to postwar intellectual life.Thomas Wheatland is an assistant professor of German history at Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Believing The Lie (An Inspector Lynley Novel)</h2><p>Going undercover to investigate the death of a drowning victim at the request of the man's wealthy and influential uncle, Inspector Thomas Lynley uncovers dark secrets in his client's family while one of Lynley's partners, Deborah St. James, becomes increasingly obsessed with a chief suspect's wife.

Speech! (2001) - all published in Penguin - and now this new volume. All these books are driven by a profound quarrel with the modern world. This new book consists of 72 numbered poems, each of 24 lines. Together they make up a kind of Dantean eclogue in which the landscape of Hill&#39;s youth - rural Worcestershire - offers a glimpse of paradise in the midst of the modern world. This is a major poet writing serious, beautiful poetry.</p><p>Geoffrey Hill was born in Bromsgrove, Worcs, in 1932, the son of a local policeman. He taught for many years at the Universities of Leeds and Cambridge, but moved to the USA in 1988 and is currently Professor of Literature and Religion at the University of Boston. He is widely regarded as one of our greatest poets.Wildly allusive, painfully self-aware and on occasion radiant, this long and winding poem in 72 blank-verse sections completes a trilogy of personal long poems from the frighteningly learned English poet, long in residence in Boston. Having admired Hill's meticulous lyric for three decades, poets and critics on both sides of the Atlantic were startled by 1998's forthright The Triumph of Love, a book-length poem about history, memory, violence, Christianity, contemporary Britain and Hill's own career (he teaches at Boston University). That book and its successor, Speech! Speech! (2000), showed a poet with great gifts, but one so absorbed by his topical complaints and idiosyncratic learning that his work seemed brilliant but overambitious, and perhaps too much to navigate. Hill's new volume retains its predecessors' range of reference (Bach, Coleridge, minor prophets, Methodist hymns, Leopardi, Heine, Frank O'Hara, D.H. Lawrence, Ingmar Bergman and more). Where Speech! tended wryly toward rant, the new books shows its aging poet-hero finding, if fitfully, happiness, pastoral space and consolation, as the title, and the recurrent mention of Hopkins's "Goldengrove," imply. Some segments suggest a tour of rural and suburban England ("the breadth of this/ autumnal land"); others celebrate earlier artists' "resounding mastery of things hard laboured" or mourn "through a high formal keening." Finally, Hill contemplates his advancing years, and his poetic projects, with a remarkable music and a rueful look at his own ambitions: "I can see only so far; I can say/ only so much." (Mar.) Forecast: Hill published an average of a book a decade before Triumph, and moved from Houghton Mifflin to Counterpoint for Speech!. This better and easier fourth book in six years (counting 1997's Cannan) should provoke a few major assessments of Hill's career. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>American Cichlids II: Large Cichlids : A Handbook for Their Identification, Care, and Breeding</h2><p>Book by Staeck, Wolfgang, Linke, Horst</p><p></p><h2>We Lived There Too: In Their Own Words and Pictures Pioneer Jews and the Westward Movement of America 1630-1930</h2><p>This new documentary tells the story of the Jews who went West with their fellow immigrants to make new lives for themselves in &#34;the new country.&#34; Constructed out of a rich treasury of many hitherto unpublished diaries, memoirs, and letters, together with a fascination selection of contemporary newspaper articles, photographs and drawings, We Lived There Too is a chronicle of the gritty texture of real lives, real people - their faults and foibles tempered by enormous reservoirs of courage and humanity.</p><p></p><h2>Wines of the Graves</h2><p>This guide to the &#34;cradle of claret&#34; in southwest France, describes the vineyards, wines and colorfulhistory of the region.</p><p></p><h2>The Open Cage: An Anzia Yezierska Collection</h2><p><p><strong>A story that compares the life of an old woman to that of an ailing bird.</strong></p></p><p>Anzia Yezierska (1882-1970)&nbsp;was born in Poland and came to the Lower East Side of New York with her family in 1890 when she was nine years old.&nbsp; By the 1920s she had risen out of poverty and become a successful writer of stories, novels&#x2015;all autobiographical&#x2015;and an autobiography, Red Ribbon on a White Horse (Persea).

In 1973 his legacy was permanently etched into the consciousness of the world when he won the Triple Crown. Here, Raymond G.

The first authorized biography and chronology of the life and career of the legendary American Thoroughbred champion, <i>Secretariat</i> was originally published in 1974 immediately following his retirement from racing to stud at Claiborne Farm. The book was an instant success, favorably reviewed by NY Times, CBS TV, NBC TV, Sports Illustrated, Daily Racing Form, Time, Philadelphia Inquirer, Blood-Horse, and many other major media. Selling over 60,000 copies in its first 8 months and named to B. Dalton's prestigious "perennial list"(a tribute in the trade to a book considered to be a timeless best seller), <i>Secretariat</i> took on numbers which had been the privilege of few other books about horses. Today, book sellers specializing in out of print editions are reaping prices of from $350 upwards to $600 for first edition copies of the book. Copies signed by the author along with signatures of some or all of <i>Secretariat</i>'s entourage are valued at over $2,000 a copy. The magic of the great horse is incurable. <p>In 1989, Mr. Woolfe published a limited, leather bound collectors edition, now also out of print, which sold over 1000 copies at $250 each. The edition offered an expanded text covering <i>Secretariat</i>'s breeding career, racing records of his offspring, and a recording of Lucien Laurin's complete training diary for the horse. A groundswell of demand for a popularly priced edition of the book led Mr. Woolfe to re-publish the book for this 25th anniversary year of <i>Secretariat</i>'s Triple Crown victory. Bound in a heavy weight, full color paperback cover, the book measures in at the same coffee table size of 10 1/2" x 10 1/4" as its predecessor and contains the full expanded text of 212 pages, including 32 pages of full color (over 55 color illustrations and over 150 black &amp; white). At a suggested retail price of only $30, <i>Secretariat</i> is a prize worth having.

She is the avatar of of a god known at That-Which-Destroys, the god of chaos and ruin. Yet Jame is also a noblewoman within an ancient race, and the designated heir of her twin brother Torisen Knorth, High Lord of the Kencyrath. Jame&#x2019;s people are fleeing, world by world, from a terrible enemy that has pursued them through a multitude of universes. Its name is Perimal Darkling.<br> <br>Obeying instructions from her brother, Jame sets out with a force of Southron warriors to reestablish the long-fallen castle keep of Tagmeth. By Jame&#x2019;s side is Lyra, a devious Kencyrath noble girl who is determined not to be forced into a marriage with a man she despises. Jame&#x2019;s old friends Mark and Brier Iron-thorn stand with her, as well: Marc, steward and organizer of Jame&#x2019;s household and Brier, the only captain under her command wholly sworn to support Jame no matter the cost. Jame finds more allies in the forest surrounding the ancient keep where the wild people of the woodlands, the Merikit, hold court. And Jame&#x2019;s adopted mother, Gran Cyd, matriarch and queen of the Merikit, may once again provide the voice of calm that Jame requires to survive her own tempestuous nature.<br> <br>Jame sets about establishing Tagmeth as an outpost against the gathering power of Perimal Darkling. But Tagmeth hides a secret, a gateway to a mystery that may save this world from eternal darkness&#x2014;or plunge it to destruction and ruin all the sooner. It is up to Jame to find her way through Perimal Darkling&#x2019;s traps, and to come to terms with the god of pandemonium and destruction within her who grows stronger every day. If she succeeds it may be that Perimal Darkling can finally be defeated after eons of fear and flight. And if she fails, yet another world will fall to darkness forever.<br> <br> <b>About <i>The Gates of Tagmeth</i>:</b><br> <br> "The Kencyr live in one of the most deeply realized worlds in fantasy, a rich and complicated space that includes many cultures and riveting, three-dimensional characters.

He was<br>fishing on the north shore of Chew Valley Lake, a 1200-acre<br>reservoir at the foot of the Mendip Hills south of Bristol. He<br>had already taken three brown trout of respectable weight.<br><br>He watched keenly for a telltale swirl in the calm lake<br>where he had cast. The conditions were promising. It was an<br>evening late in September, the sky was overcast and the flies<br>in their millions had just whirled above him in their spectacular<br>sunset flight, soaring and swooping over the lake in a<br>mass darker and more dense than the clouds, their droning<br>as resonant as a train in the underground. The day&#x2019;s hatch,<br>irresistible to hungry fish.<br><br>A light south-westerly fretted the surface around him, yet<br>ahead there was this bar of water, known to fishermen as the<br>scum, that showed a different pattern in the fading light.<br>There, he knew by experience, the fish preferred to rise.<br><br>So preoccupied was the man that he failed altogether to<br>notice a pale object at closer proximity. It drifted languidly<br>in the current created by the wind, more than half submerged,<br>with a slight rocking motion that fitfully produced<br>a semblance of life.<br><br>Finally it touched him. A white hand slid against his<br>thigh. A complete arm angled outwards as the body lodged<br>against him, trapped at the armpit. It was a dead woman,<br>face-up and naked.<br><br>The fisherman glanced down. From high in his throat<br>came a childishly shrill, indrawn cry.<br><br>For a moment he stood as if petrified. Then he made an<br>effort to gather himself mentally so as to disentangle himself<br>from the undesired embrace. Unwilling to touch the<br>corpse with his hands, he used the handle of the rod as a<br>lever, lodging the end in the armpit and pushing the body<br>away from him, turning it at the same time, then stepping<br>aside to let it move on its way with the current. That accomplished,<br>he grabbed his net from its anchorage in the mud<br>and, without even stopping to reel in his line, splashed his<br>way to the bank. There, he looked about him. No one was<br>in sight.<br><br>This angler was not public-spirited. His response to the<br>discovery was to bundle his tackle together and move off to<br>his car as fast as possible.<br><br>He did have one judicious thought. Before leaving, he<br>opened the bag containing his catch and threw the three<br>trout back into the water.<br>TWO <br><br>A LITTLE AFTER 10.30 THE same Saturday evening,<br>Police Constable Harry Sedgemoor and his wife Shirley<br>were watching a horror video in their terraced cottage in<br>Bishop Sutton, on the eastern side of the lake. PC Sedgemoor<br>had come off duty at six. His long body was stretched<br>along the length of the sofa, his bare feet projecting over<br>one end. On this hot night he had changed into a black<br>singlet and shorts. A can of Malthouse Bitter was in his left<br>hand, while his right was stroking Shirley&#x2019;s head, idly teasing<br>out the black curls and feeling them spring back into<br>shape. Shirley, after her shower dressed only in her white<br>cotton nightie, reclined on the floor, propped against the<br>sofa. She had her eyes closed. She had lost interest in the<br>film, but she didn&#x2019;t object to Harry watching if it resulted<br>afterwards in his snuggling up close to her in bed, as he<br>usually did after watching a horror film. Secretly, she suspected<br>he was more scared by them than she, but you didn&#x2019;t<br>suggest that sort of thing to your husband, particularly if he<br>happened to be a policeman. So she waited patiently for<br>it to end. The tape hadn&#x2019;t much longer to run. Harry had<br>several times pressed the fast-forward button to get through<br>boring bits of conversation.<br><br>The violins on the video soundtrack were working up to<br>a piercing crescendo when the Sedgemoors both heard the<br>click of their own front gate. Shirley said bitterly, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t<br>believe it! What time is it?&#x2019;<br><br>Her husband sighed, swung his legs off the sofa, got up<br>and looked out of the window. &#x2018;Some woman.&#x2019; He couldn&#x2019;t<br>see much in the porch light.<br><br>He recognized the caller when he opened the door:<br>Miss Trenchard-Smith, who lived alone in one of the older<br>houses at the far end of the village. An upright seventy-yearold<br>never seen without her Tyrolean hat, which over the<br>years had faded in colour from a severe brown to a shade<br>that was starting to fit in with the deep pink of the local<br>stone.<br><br>&#x2018;I hesitate to disturb you so late, Officer,&#x2019; she said as her<br>eyes travelled over his shorts and singlet in a series of rapid<br>jerks. &#x2018;However, I think you will agree that what I have found<br>is sufficiently serious to justify this intrusion.&#x2019; Her gratingly<br>genteel accent articulated the words with self-importance.<br>She may have lived in the village since the war, but she<br>would never pass as local and probably didn&#x2019;t care to.<br>PC Sedgemoor said with indulgence, &#x2018;What might that<br>be, Miss Trenchard-Smith?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A dead body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A body?&#x2019; He fingered the tip of his chin and tried to<br>appear unperturbed, but his pulses throbbed. After six<br>months in the force he had yet to be called to a corpse.<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith continued with her explanation.<br>&#x2018;I was walking my cats by the lake. People don&#x2019;t believe that<br>cats like to be taken for walks, but mine do. Every evening<br>about this time. They insist on it. They won&#x2019;t let me sleep if<br>I haven&#x2019;t taken them out.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A human body, you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, of course. A woman. Not a stitch of clothing on<br>her, poor creature.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d better show me. Is it . . . is she nearby?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;In the lake, if she hasn&#x2019;t floated away already.&#x2019;<br><br>Sedgemoor refrained from pointing out that the body<br>would remain in the lake even if it had floated away. He<br>needed Miss Trenchard-Smith&#x2019;s co-operation. He invited<br>her into the cottage for a moment while he ran upstairs to<br>collect a sweater and his personal radio.<br><br>Shirley, meanwhile, had stood up and wished a good evening<br>to Miss Trenchard-Smith, whose tone in replying made<br>it plain that in her view no respectable woman ought to be<br>seen in her nightwear outside the bedroom.<br><br>&#x2018;What a horrid experience for you!&#x2019; Shirley remarked,<br>meaning what had happened beside the lake. &#x2018;Would you<br>care for a nip of something to calm you down?&#x2019;<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith curtly thanked her and declined.<br>&#x2018;But you can look after my cats while I&#x2019;m gone,&#x2019; she said as<br>if bestowing a favour on Shirley. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mind cats, do<br>you?&#x2019; Without pausing to get an answer she went to the door<br>and called, &#x2018;Come on, come on, come on,&#x2019; and two Siamese<br>raced from the shadows straight into the cottage and leapt<br>on to the warm spot Harry had vacated on the sofa as if it<br>were prearranged.<br><br>When Harry came down again, Shirley glanced at what<br>he was wearing and said, &#x2018;I thought you were going upstairs<br>to put some trousers on.&#x2019;<br><br>He said, &#x2018;I might have to wade in and fetch something<br>out, mightn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019;<br><br>She shuddered.<br><br>He picked his torch off the shelf by the door. Managing<br>to sound quite well in control, he said, &#x201c;Bye, love.&#x2019; He<br>kissed Shirley lightly and tried to provide more reassurance<br>by whispering, &#x2018;I expect she imagined it.&#x2019;<br><br>Not that tough old bird, Shirley thought. If she says she<br>found a corpse, it&#x2019;s there.<br><br>Harry Sedgemoor was less certain. While driving Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith the half-mile or so down to the lakeside<br>he seriously speculated that she might be doing this out<br>of a desire to enliven her placid routine with gratuitous<br>excitement. Old women living alone had been known to<br>waste police time with tall stories. If this were the case he<br>would be incensed. He was damned sure Shirley wouldn&#x2019;t<br>want to make love after this. Whatever there might or<br>might not be in the lake, the mention of a corpse would<br>colour her imagination so vividly that nothing he did or<br>said would relax her.<br><br>With an effort to be the policeman, he asked Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith to tell him where to stop the car.<br><br>&#x2018;Anywhere you like,&#x2019; she said with an ominously nonchalant<br>air. &#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea where we are.&#x2019;<br><br>He halted where the road came to an end. They got out<br>and started across a patch of turf, his torch probing the<br>space ahead. The reservoir was enclosed by a low boundary<br>fence, beyond which clumps of reeds stirred in the breeze,<br>appearing to flicker in the torchlight. At intervals were flat<br>stretches of shoreline.<br><br>&#x2018;How exactly did you get down to the water?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>&#x2018;Through one of the gates.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Those are for fishermen only.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t disturb them.&#x2019; She gave a laugh. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t tell anyone<br>you broke the law.&#x2019;<br><br>He pushed open a gate and they picked their way down<br>to the water&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x2018;Was this the place?&#x2019;<br><br>She said, &#x2018;It all looks amazingly different now.&#x2019;<br><br>Containing his annoyance, he drew the torch-beam<br>slowly across a wide angle. &#x2018;You must have some idea. How<br>did you notice the body?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There was still some daylight then.&#x2019;<br><br>Fifty yards along the bank was a place where the reeds<br>grew extra tall. &#x2018;Anywhere like that?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I suppose there&#x2019;s no harm in looking,&#x2019; she said.<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, miss.&#x2019;<br><br>He stepped in and felt his foot sink into soft mud. &#x2018;You&#x2019;d</p><h2>A Curse So Dark and Lonely: Brigid Kemmerer (The Cursebreaker Series)</h2><p><p><b>'Everything you'd want in a retelling of a classic fairy tale' JODI PICOULT</b><br><b>'Absolutely spellbinding' STEPHANIE GARBER</b><br><b></b><br><b><i>Fall in love, break the curse.</i></b><br><i><b>Break the curse, save the kingdom.</b></i></p><p>Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall, is cursed.

The fact that nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and intellectual emergency.&#34; In response to his award-winning bestseller The End of Faith, Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God. Letter to A Christian Nation is his courageous and controversial reply. Using rational argument, Harris offers a measured refutation of the beliefs that form the core of fundamentalist Christianity. Addressing current topics ranging from intelligent design and stem-cell research to the connections between religion and violence, Letter to a Christian Nation boldly challenges the influence that faith has on American public life.</p><p><b>Jordan Bridges</b>' film credits include <i>Mona Lisa Smile, Frequency</i>, and <i>The New Suit</i>.

Its adaptation of mediated, popular-culture imagery continues to influence artists, but until now, little attention has been paid to the important contributions that women made to the movement. Pop Art by women dealt less with direct consumerist critiques, instead subversively combating the stereotypical perceptions of women via advertising and film clich�s. Work by women Pop artists ranges from Rosalyn Drexler&#x2019;s surreal film-noir riffs, Idelle Weber&#x2019;s New Realism office workers, and Niki de Saint Phalle&#x2019;s exuberant Nanas to the more controversial and blatantly political statements of Faith Ringgold and Martha Rosler. Pauline Boty and Axell explored female desire, while the innovative soft structures stitched by Yayoi Kusama, Jann Haworth, Patty Mucha, and others form an important contribution to the history of sculpture.<br> <br> <i>Seductive Subversion: Women Pop Artists 1958 1968</i> is the catalogue of the first exhibition to expand Pop Art&#x2019;s narrow critical definition to reflect the significant role of these women artists. The culmination of six years of research by Sid Sachs, this exhibition, organized by the Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery of the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, is touring nationally. The essays in this catalogue span from London&#x2019;s Independent Group in the early 1950s to the end of classic Pop in 1968. Written by the art historians Linda Nochlin, Sid Sachs, Kalliopi Minioudaki, Bradford R. Collins, Annika �hrner, and Sue Tate and the artists Martha Rosler and Patty Mucha, these texts will be revelations and will remain a vital reference for artists, art and cultural historians, and feminists alike. Artworks by more than twenty artists are reproduced, including Pauline Boty, Chryssa, Rosalyn Drexler, Jann Haworth, Yayoi Kusama, and Marisol, as well as now lesser-known figures such as Barbro �stlihn and Dorothy Grebenak. Numerous works are discussed in depth from a number of vantage points.</p><p><b>Sid Sachs</b>, curator of <i>Seductive Subversion</i>, is Director of Exhibitions, Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery, University of the Arts, Philadelphia.

The ursine stars of this popular nonsense ditty provide plenty of opportunity for Hague to draw his favorite subjects. In a fairly literal interpretation of the lyrics, he shows lots of teddy bears, in various shapes, sizes, and degrees of cuteness, heading into an autumnal wood to cavort well beyond the watchful eyes of their human owners. Children will not fail to miss the one curious child who follows his own teddy to the picnic site, since he is the one creature whose pale visage and upright posture are distinctly human despite his fuzzy bear costume. ?- Combining realism with romanticism, Hague remains true to his highly recognizable style, creating an appealing fantasy world full of curious details such as lithesome fairies and other fey creatures rendered in pen-and-ink line drawings washed in warm earth tones and livened by touches of soft reds and blues. The arhythmic, and at times, nonrhyming verse, captioned in unobtrusive black-bordered boxes and set against the full double-page illustrations, might read awkwardly to those unfamiliar with the tune. Unfortunately, no musical notation is provided. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Pub .

From that later decade we have the letters of Paul...From them, above all else, we receive the temptation to gloss speedily over the 30s or 40s and move swiftly to those better-documented 50s...Before there was Paul the apostle in the early 50s, there was Paul the persecutor in the early 30s. What was there for him to persecute?"<br>-from <em>The Birth of Christianity</em><p>In this long-awaited companion to his landmark <em>The Historical Jesus,</em> John Dominic Crossan, the world's foremost expert on the historical Jesus, explores the lost years of earliest Christianity, those immediately following the execution of Jesus. He establishes the contextual setting by an interdisciplinary combination of anthropological, historical, and archaeological approaches. He identifies the textual sources by a literary analysis of the earliest discernible layers within our present gospels, both inside and outside the New Testament. Context and text come together to challenge long-standing assumptions about the role of Paul and the meaning of resurrection, and to forge an eloquent and powerful new understanding of the birth of the Christian church.</p><p>John Dominic Crossan, one of the most influential figures in biblical scholarship, combines innovative scholarship with compelling insight in illuminating the mysteries of the origins of Christianity. Crossan's meticulous research into the anthropological milieu within which Christianity arose, and his study of the emergence of early Christian communities, form the basis for his stunning and original theory. Separating history from theology and redaction, he presents a vivid account of early Christianity's interaction with the world around it, and of the new traditions and communities established as Jesus' companions continued their movement after his death.</p><p>With ancient traditional Judaism under increasing pressure from both Roman commercial exploitation and Greek cultural domination, the Kingdom-of-God movement of Jesus and his followers establish radical but non-violent resistance in the Lower Galilee of the late 20s. As early Jewish and Greek-influenced schools of thought present competing visions of the nature of the spirit and the flesh, it is the message brought by Jesus during his life that creates the spiritual center of the early church. </p><p>The Resurrection, while essential to the story of Christ as told through the centuries, is understood in a different light when presented in the setting of a Mediterranean culture in which events such as apparitions by the dead and ecstatic visions were far from unusual. While the eschatological teachings of Paul play a large role in the growth and development of the church, they are seen to follow, rather than define, the moment of its birth.</p><p>Ground-breaking and brilliantly crafted, <em>The Birth of Christianity</em> is an indispensable addition to our understanding of the origins of the Christian faith.</p><p>John Dominic Crossan is the author of <em>The Historical Jesus, Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography, Who Killed Jesus?,</em> and <em>Who Is Jesus?</em> He chairs the Historical Jesus section of the Society of Biblical Literature and was codirector of the Jesus Seminar. John Dominic Crossan, the world's foremost expert and best-selling author on the historical Jesus, presents a fascinating and essential inquiry into the rise of Christianity in the years preceding and immediately following the Crucifixion. Crossan's interdisciplinary approach sheds new light on the cultural and theological context in which the Christian church arose, and raises essential questions about the role of St. Paul and the significance of the Resurrection.</p></p><p>John Dominic Crossan is the leading contemporary scholar on the historical Jesus, which means that his vocation is to look behind, around, and through Christ's resurrection, toward the goal of establishing what can be known about the life of Jesus of Nazareth. <p> His search for the historical Jesus, however, takes place in the larger context of the life of the church. Among the goals of <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> is to teach readers how our habits of worship have created false gods. To that end, Crossan attempts to unearth the religion's earliest forms. What did Christianity look like, Crossan asks, between the crucifixion and the conversion of Paul? And what might Christianity look like today had Saul never set off toward Damascus? </p><p> Crossan's conclusions don't come from newly discovered documents; they come from freshly-minted academic methodologies. He uses anthropology, history, and archaeology to construct his arguments about the essential nature of both Jesus' religion and Paul's. The 25-cent summary of his conclusion is that Jesus did not recognize the dualism between spirit and flesh that formed the basis of Paul's apocalyptic Christianity. In other words, Jesus was more Jewish than Paul. </p><p> The ramifications of this argument are huge. Crossan says much of Christian worship--and many of the world's injustices--are based on the dualistic Christ that Paul preached. Though Crossan doesn't bully readers into accepting his conclusions, he does press hard for them to situate their own beliefs in relation to his interpretations of Jesus and Paul. At every point in the evolution of his argument, he asks readers questions such as "How do you understand a human being?" and "What is the character of your God?" Then he proceeds to answer these questions himself. Finally, he tells readers what he thinks these answers mean. </p><p> It's an incredibly civilized style of argument--both spiritually and intellectually respectful and always rhetorically engaging. Though <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> weighs in at almost 600 pages of text, you'll probably want to read every word. And after that, you'll probably be hungry for more.</p>John Dominic Crossan, the world's foremost expert and bestselling author on the historical Jesus, presents a fascinating and essential inquiry into the rise of Christianity in the years preceding and immediately following the Crucifixion. Crossan's interdisciplinary approach sheds new light on the cultural and theological context in which the Christian church arose and raises essential questions about the role of St. Paul and the significance of the Resurrection. <p>"Christianity arose out of the interaction of the historical Jesus and his first companions. It was not invented by Paul. That is the stunning hypothesis of Crossan's <i>The Birth of Christianity.</i> Like the master craftsman he is, Crossan has forged a picture of the earliest Christianity--of the dark years, the 30s and 40s [B.C.E.]--in debate with other scholars and in the combination of social science theory, Galilean archeology, close textual analysis, and historical reconstruction. No one controls the issues, the data, and the options as well as Crossan. His reconstruction is essential reading for anyone serious about Christian origins and its fate in the third millennium."--Robert W. Funk, chair, The Jesus Seminar, and author of <i>The Acts of Jesus</i> </p><p>Praise for earlier work by John Dominic Crossan: </p><p>"[John Dominic Crossan is] excellent and timely in drawing on aspects of social anthropological theory to elucidate the thought processes and human relationships behind the extant sources. He and his colleagues in American biblical studies have done a great service in recent years in bringing these perspectives to bear on the origins of Christianity.... Mr. Crossan paints his Jesus with great warmth and power."

The author of many science fiction and fantasy novels, he is best known for his Guardians of the Flame fantasy series. He lives in Minneapolis with his wife Felicia, two daughters, one sister, five cats, one dog and a couple of dozen fish.</p>The moderately involving sixth installment in the Guardians of the Flame series, following The Warrior Lives , finds Walter Slovotsky, the dwarf Ahira, wizard Andrea Cullinane and her son Jason on the road to Ehvenor to find out why the world of Faerie appears to be increasing its disruptive incursions into Eren, the world of men. They are also searching for Mikyn, Jason's childhood friend, who appears to have taken on the identity of the Warrior (originally Jason's father, Karl) and begun indiscriminately killing slave owners. The rescue of Walter's associates from Home, the settlement devoted to developing Earth technology in Eren, nearly leads to the group's destruction. But they finally reach Ehvenor, only to find an even more dangerous mission involving a malignant spirit (or faerie lord) and Faerie's chaotic, vastly different natural laws. Rosenberg's continuing saga of seven fantasy-game players translated from Earth to a magic-ridden medieval land has its moments, training a wry modern sensibility on unsavory practices like slave trading. Unfortunately, as is the case with many series, it will be difficult for new readers to drop in at this point and find their bearings, although a few hints are vouchsafed. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sailing Frigate: A History in Ship Models</h2><p>The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich houses the largest collection of scale ship models in the world.

Reyes National Seashore, preserving California&#39;s unspoiled North Coast, and transforming the political landscape of Marin County.</p><p>Sweetwater Springs Press proudly announces the release of Dr. Marty Griffin&#39;s long-awaited memoir, &#34;Saving the Marin-Sonoma Coast,&#34; a captivating and richly illustrated personal account of the daring strategies that helped preserve Northern California&#39;s natural treasures - Richardson Bay on San Francisco Bay, Bolinas Lagoon, Tomales Bay, the Point Reyes National Seashore, and the Russian River. A physician and lifelong environmentalist who played a leading role in these battles, Dr. Griffin is well known as co-founder of Audubon Canyon Ranch. He will be appearing throughout the Bay Area with slide presentations and book signings.Few Californians realize how narrowly the North Coast counties of Marin and Sonoma escaped becoming tentacles of Southern California and its notorious water schemes. In 1957, fifteen years before voters created the California Coastal Commission, a few conservationists in Marin began plotting a revolution to save its bays, birds, tidelands, and coastline, and to help protect the Point Reyes Peninsula from being suburbanized by the state&#x2019;s aggressive freeway, water, and real estate lobbies. <p>Their determination led to a citizens revolt against dams and imported water, unprecedented in semi-arid California. Voters shattered Marin&#x2019;s "old boy" politics and transformed its land-use ethic. By "designing with nature" Marin protected its beauty, wildlife, and economy to become one of California&#x2019;s best planned and slowest growing counties. </p><p>For years my friends have urged me to tell this story of the creation of the three Audubon Canyon Ranch wildlife preserves in Marin and Sonoma Counties, and the years of struggle to protect California&#x2019;s coastal watersheds and to keep the Russian and Eel Rivers wild. My hope is that this history can serve as a model for other counties where damaging growth is dictated by developers. </p><p>Lest the public forget and let them erode, here are the reasons why two-thirds of Marin, including its encircling bays and marshlands and the Point Reyes Peninsula, are permanent open space, wildlife preserves, parks, and farmland; why there are no freeways on the Marin-Sonoma-Mendocino coast; why the salmon rivers of the North Coast (except the Russian) are protected as Wild and Scenic Rivers; why every California river now requires a watershed management plan; why all the state&#x2019;s tidelands are now legally preserved; and why the public has access to much of the eleven-hundred-mile California coast. </p><p>The battle is never over.</p></p><h2>Ice Diaries: An Antarctic Memoir</h2><p><p><b><i>What do we stand to lose in a world without ice?</i></b></p> <p>A decade ago, novelist and short story writer Jean McNeil spent a year as writer-in-residence with the British Antarctic Survey, and four months on the world&#x2019;s most enigmatic continent &#x2015; Antarctica.

In entering this world, McNeil unexpectedly finds herself confronting her own upbringing in the Maritimes, the lifelong effects of growing up in a cold place, and how the climates of childhood frame our emotional thermodynamics for life. <i>Ice Diaries</i> is a haunting story of the relationship between beauty and terror, loss and abandonment, transformation and triumph.</p></p><p><p><b>Jean McNeil</b> is the author of ten books including four novels and a collection of short fiction.

When European explorers first traveled to the area, these islands were inhabited by the Chumash, some of the most populous and culturally complex hunter-gatherers known. Chumash society was characterized by hereditary leaders, sophisticated exchange networks and interaction spheres, and diverse maritime economies. Focusing on the archaeology of five sites dated to the last 3,000 years, this book examines the archaeology and historical ecology of San Miguel Island, the westernmost and most isolated of the northern Channel Islands. Detailed faunal, artifact, and other data are woven together in a diachronic analysis that investigates the interplay of social and ecological developments on this unique island. The first to focus solely on San Miguel Island archaeology, this book examines issues ranging from coastal adaptations to emergent cultural complexity to historical ecology and human impacts on ancient environments.</p></p><p><p>The first to focus solely on San Miguel Island archaeology, this book examines issues ranging from coastal adaptations to emergent cultural complexity to historical ecology and human impacts on ancient environments.</p><p>Torben C.

With great precision, clarity of color, and an unwavering instinct for composition, he addresses both important photographic motifs and informal, often little-known subjects. Struth characteristically treats the various aspects of his photographs in an even-handed way, a neutrality he also applies to the viewer, for he puts the viewing public on a par with his pictorial world.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Struth poses aesthetically formulated issues that make such an impact not least because they concern us personally and are, above all, crucial to the future of human civilization.&#x201d;</b><br><br>This lavish volume is the most comprehensive study of Struth&#x2019;s &#x153;uvre, showcasing all of the famous series and images: the streetscapes of D�sseldorf, New York City, Rome, China, and elsewhere; the family portraits; the museum photographs; the flowers, plants, and rainforests; and most recently, the studies of science and technology. Struth revisits many of his subjects, adding ever more layers of complexity and interpretation. Essays by renowned curators and critics complete this essential study of one of the world&#x2019;s major artists.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Struth&#x2019;s work suspends both belief and doubt and shifts the subject to a bigger picture about the inescapable entanglement of experience and ideology.&#x201d;</b></p><p><b>Thomas Struth </b>was born in 1954 in Geldern, Germany, and now lives in D�sseldorf and Berlin.

He received his MFA from the University of California, Riverside, where he studied fiction and poetry. An avid outdoorsman, he currently lives in Kelowna, British Columbia, northeast of Vancouver with his wife, two kids, and a Siberian husky. <i>The Wolves of Winter </i>is his first novel.The Wolves of Winter 1<p></p> <br>The trap was empty and the snow was bloody, which meant one of three things.<br> <br>One: The animal had gotten itself loose, making a mess in the process. Unlikely. Too much blood.<br> <br>Two: Wolves had gotten to it and somehow managed to drag the carcass out of the trap. Even more unlikely. Not enough blood. Or hair. Besides, their tracks would have been obvious.<br> <br>Three: Conrad had poached my kill.<br> <br>Thieving, asshole Conrad. Not only likely but, based on the boot prints and snakelike trails that his sled made through the bloody Rorschach marks in the snow, it was the only option. It had snowed early that morning, maybe an hour before the sun crested the hills. A thin dusting had already settled over his prints. He got up early, you had to give Conrad that much. Stealing didn&#x2019;t seem like him, though. He was an ass, no doubt about it, but a thief?<br> <br>The animal&#x2019;s prints were teardrops, scattered about the bloody mush of snow. Teardrops meant deer. And by the size of the prints, it was a buck. My wire had been snipped too. I&#x2019;d placed it between two pine trees in a small ravine. The logjams on either side were a bitch to set up, but they herded the animals into the trap. I took the broken wire between my gloved fingers. You know how rare wire was nowadays? I could repair it, but it wouldn&#x2019;t hold as strong. I was always careful to remove the wire by unthreading it from the tree and the animal so that I could use it again. I was pissed.<br> <br>I adjusted my compound bow under my arm and the rope over my left shoulder. The rope was attached to my sled. My uncle Jeryl&#x2014;Dad&#x2019;s brother&#x2014;had made the sled for me four years earlier. About three feet wide, six feet long. It carried small game no problem, a deer was tough for me but manageable, and an elk, caribou, or moose I had to butcher first and carry just the meat. The sled was made of spruce and had bloodstains from past kills splattered about the wood, but it was sturdy. I always dragged it along with me to check the traps.<br> <br>A slight easterly wind stung my nose and cracked lips. The sun was gray and bored in the hazy sky, but the fresh fallen snow was still blinding. Sunglasses. I missed sunglasses. I headed southeast, into the wind. It was less than a mile to Conrad&#x2019;s place. Dragging the sled made it tough going, but I didn&#x2019;t care. No way in hell I was going to let him keep my kill. He was a big man, though, and he was stronger than me.<br> <br>Somewhere, a gray jay woke and started chattering. The wind blew a dusting of snow from the ground that billowed like smoke in the chill morning air, and the sun, not giving a shit about my deer, was probably already contemplating its early descent.<br> <br>I was sixteen when we left Eagle, Alaska. When things got bad, when everyone seemed to be leaving, we up and left too. We headed into the Yukon Territory. To the trees, hills, mountains, valleys, rivers, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow. The vast wilderness of nothing. But for the next seven years, that nothing became home. I got used to it. The whiteness a comfort, the pine trees a refuge, the silence of it a friend I never knew I needed or wanted.<br> <br>Being twenty-three now, looking back on my sixteen-year-old self, Alaska feels like a different world. Or a dream. Where people had jobs, hobbies, possessions, friends, and things like ovens, TV, cereal, toasters, pizza. But what made that life real for me was Dad. His death didn&#x2019;t feel like a lifetime ago. I carried him with me everywhere I went.<br> <br>Conrad lived in a small log cabin next to the Blackstone River. He built the place himself, and it always looked to me like it was about to fall over. It leaned slightly to the south. Reminded me of the pine, fir, and spruce trees&#x2014;the tired-looking ones that were hunched over from the weight of the snow. They looked exhausted, depressed, like they&#x2019;d given up, given in to the arctic bully. Snow can be a burden sometimes. All the time, really. There didn&#x2019;t used to be so much of it. Before the wars and the bombs.<br> <br>When the cabin came into sight, I spotted the deer right away, lying in the snow next to Conrad&#x2019;s door. It was a buck, just like I thought, a big buck, a horse with antlers. A good kill. My kill.<br> <br>I made my way down the hill to his cabin and walked right up to the carcass. When I got close enough, I let go of the sled and surveyed the animal. The thing was stiff. A clean cut across the jugular. I knelt down and put my hands in the brown fur, then palmed the antlers, the soft velvet on the horns folding beneath my gloves. I&#x2019;d probably be able to get it on the sled and up and over the first hill or two. But from there I&#x2019;d have to run and get help to bring it all the way home. First, though, I had to get it off the damn porch. Conrad&#x2019;s porch. I wiped my frozen nose with the sleeve of my jacket.<br> <br>The door creaked open, and Conrad filled the doorway, his dark green winter coat and boots still on, and his .308 rifle held loose at his hip like he was compensating for something. &#x201c;Admiring my kill?&#x201d; He had a dense black beard and brown eyes like a wolverine&#x2019;s, sitting too close to his nose. He was a thick man. Thick around the waist, neck, face, and limbs. How he&#x2019;d managed to stay so round through the lean months I didn&#x2019;t know. He had a smell about him too&#x2014;wet wood, near to rot.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is my kill,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He just smiled. Probably had been rehearsing the conversation. &#x201c;So you slit its throat?&#x201d; His voice was low, buttery with the pleasure of the situation. He was eating this up.<br> <br>I glared, hoping some of the heat I felt in my stomach would transfer through my eyes, laser to his forehead, and burn him to charcoal. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking it back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; He set the rifle down just outside the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was my trap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was my knife, my find. How was I supposed to know it was your trap?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You knew damn well it was my trap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A poorly assembled bit of wire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Set in a ravine, with logjams on either side to herd the animals through. Don&#x2019;t be stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged, the thin smile never leaving his pinched face. I wanted to punch my fist right through it. Shatter his teeth, jaw, skull.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lovely day,&#x201d; he said, inhaling the stinging morning air, exhaling tendrils of white steam. &#x201c;A good day for butchering.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking the deer,&#x201d; I said, lifting my rope and pulling in my sled. I set down my bow, wrapped a hand around the buck&#x2019;s antlers, and started to jerk the massive bulk. Conrad grabbed my arm. His grip was firm, trying to prove something to us both.<br> <br>I yanked my arm back, but his fingers just tightened. &#x201c;Let me go!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll butcher him up, make a nice warm coat for you. We&#x2019;ll call it even. How&#x2019;d you like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad always told me that when I&#x2019;m angry, I make rash decisions. I get it from Mom. Once, back in Alaska, I broke two of my brother&#x2019;s fingers in the doorway. &#x201c;Take a breath,&#x201d; my dad would say, &#x201c;and think. Think about what you&#x2019;re going to do, what you want to happen, and if there&#x2019;s a better way to get things done.&#x201d;<br> <br>But I was too pissed at Conrad. I swung at him. Fist clenched, arm flailing. It was a stupid move. My fist connected with the edge of his jaw. His head barely tipped back. My knuckles vibrated with pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d; The word rumbled from his round belly. His eyes grew intense, like those of an animal charging. Hungry. He came at me. I might have had time to raise my arms or duck if I&#x2019;d thought the bastard would hit a girl. But I didn&#x2019;t. Didn&#x2019;t think he had it in him. So I was caught completely unaware when his fist collided with my cheek and knocked me flat to the ground. He wasn&#x2019;t wearing gloves either.<br> <br>The snow wrapped around me like a frozen blanket. My head reeled. The gray of the sky waterfalled to the earth, then the earth to the sky&#x2014;the pine trees dipped and jumped. I blinked and felt water fill my left eye where he&#x2019;d struck. Then his weight was on me, firm and heavy, full of heat and iron.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead, you asshole,&#x201d; I said, gasping. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dead man.&#x201d; My voice was weak and didn&#x2019;t carry the anger I felt.<br> <br>His hands pinned me down, his face inches from mine. I couldn&#x2019;t move. I felt a panicked helplessness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a stupid little girl.&#x201d; He shifted his weight, his stomach pressing against my side. &#x201c;You think you have a little community with rules? You don&#x2019;t. Welcome to the new world. Your brother and uncle can&#x2019;t do shit to me. They can try if they want, but I&#x2019;ll fucking kill them.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned his body again, his left elbow and forearm pushing against my chest, pinning me to the ground. Then his other hand slithered down to my thigh. &#x201c;I can do whatever I want, whenever I want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need my uncle; I&#x2019;ll kill you myself!&#x201d; I spat in his face and saw a small bead of spit land in his eyelashes, but he just blinked it away. His hand went higher up my thigh. I thrashed and tried to claw his eyeballs, but I couldn&#x2019;t reach. He was too big, the fat fuck. Then his palm was between my legs. I clenched them, but I could feel his fingers on me. They pressed, dipping and rubbing as I squirmed, helpless as a caught fox. I felt my knife dig into my hip. My H�n knife. I kept it sharp. But my hand was pinned. I couldn&#x2019;t reach it.<br> <br>He leaned in even closer, trembling, his beard tickling my chin. I was going to be sick, was going to throw up in his face. Might have been a good thing if I had.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever I want,&#x201d; he repeated.<br> <br>Then it was over. The touching, the weight, the stink of his breath. He released me and stood. I took in quick, shallow gasps of air. My cheek throbbed. I got to my feet as quick as I could and thought about going for my knife or my bow, discarded in the snow beside me. Conrad watched with a pleased look on his face. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was making a statement. Claiming territory. Drawing lines. Letting us know that he wasn&#x2019;t afraid of us.<br> <br>Either way, he was a dead man. I decided to tell him again.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dead man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Run off to your uncle.&#x201d;<br> <br>I picked up my bow, then snagged the rope attached to my sled. The buck stared at me with his dead, marble eyes. Such an impressive creature, rotting on the front step of Conrad&#x2019;s shit shack, waiting to be butchered by his careless knife. I gave Conrad one last glare before turning. But the fire didn&#x2019;t burst out of my watering eyes. It didn&#x2019;t burn him to charcoal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye bye, Gwendolynn,&#x201d; he said as I walked away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck you, Conrad.&#x201d;</p><h2>Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia</h2><p>The ancient world of Mesopotamia (from Sumer to the subsequent division into Babylonia and Assyria) vividly comes alive in this portrayal of the time period from 3100 BCE to the fall of Assyria (612 BCE) and Babylon (539 BCE).

Corporate editor of the BBC from 1988 to 1993, he bases this wide-ranging popular history of the wartime BBC on Briggs' classic history of U.K. broadcasting, the dozens of books BBC employees have written over the past 50 years, and other materials and staff interviews. When Hitler took Poland, the BBC was an "aloof and impenetrable organization" with a "vestigial" news operation and a "virtually nonexistent" reputation beyond the U.K.; the way it met the war's challenges made it "an indispensable part of British national life" and "the world's unrivaled international broadcaster." Hickman covers policy debates, listener response, hugely popular variety and music shows, and technological breakthroughs that gave war correspondents mobility. Photographs display BBC stars and staff and suggest the demanding conditions under which they worked, and their civilian and military audiences listened. <i>Mary Carroll</i>During World War II, the BBC?the "auntie" of the title?provided not only news and entertainment but also a sense of social unity and an enormous boost to the morale of a war-torn population. Through its power, Churchill was able to address the whole nation, as Roosevelt did in his radio "fireside chats." Hickman, a British journalist and former corporate editor of the BBC, has put together a generously illustrated, popular history of the BBC during the war years. It will nicely complement Asa Briggs's The War of Words (1971), Volume 3 of his scholarly, multivolume History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom (1961). Suitable for public and academic libraries, especially for collections in media and communications.?Patricia A. Beaber, Trenton State Coll.

While the character of Harriet is largely fictional, her story is set firmly within an authentic historical context. The plot is revealed through Harriet's diary, a device that occasionally seems forced. A very light-skinned slave, she is favored in the Monticello household where she feels secure and protected. Other less fortunate members of the slave community urge her to make plans to take her freedom when she turns 21, a freedom that Jefferson has promised to all of the children of his supposed mistress, Sally Hemings. It is not until she is almost raped by the drunken husband of Jefferson's granddaughter that Harriet begins to contemplate what life might be like at Monticello after Jefferson dies. Thus, she makes the decision to move to Washington, D. C., and to pass as white. Knowing that this is her best hope for a decent life does not prevent her from feeling guilt over abandoning her race or grief over leaving behind all that she knows and loves. The moral dilemmas Harriet faces are played out against the backdrop of Jefferson's own ambivalence about the institution of slavery. The most telling observation in the novel is that the whites find slavery most repugnant when those enslaved look almost white themselves. Harriet's plight is poignant, and she is a finely drawn, believable character. The racism inherent in the enslavement of Africans is clearly exposed. The evils of slavery appear in a stark light even in the relatively benign environment of Monticello. Exploring the thoughts and feelings of both blacks and whites, this book should provide readers with insights into one of the most significant moral problems in American history. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The 19-year-old daughter of Thomas Jefferson and a slave woman faces conflicts concerning her lineage; PW praised this "intelligent yet earthy history that lends insight into the complex feelings surrounding race relations."

Another jam-packed jelly-rolled jeremiad of quirky and quixotic conundrums, caustic cant and comforting clutter -- all catchy, quippish and cholesterol-free -- culled from that disturbingly widespread cartoon strip Life in Hell by none other that the Simpsons creator himself, Matt Groening! Joyful angst, merry bitterness and heartwarming alienation abound in the big fiery tent that is The Huge Book of Hell. There&#39;s room for everyone in this capacious compenium! See naked little men en fez! Hear the whimsical musings of a small fry! Sing the battle hymn of Hell! Obey the law of the briny deep! Experience the finality of death! Life in Hell was the syndicated newspaper cartoon strip by Matt Groening which ran in the States during the 80s and early 90s. Asked to turn the characters into TV animation, Groening instead developed The Simpsons, retaining many of the characteristics of Binky, Bongo, Sheba, Jeff and Akbar in the series. In a world where The Simpsons and Futurama are as popular as ever, these hellish cartoons featuring Matt Groening&#39;s zany brand of comic genius are simply gold dust.</p><p>Matt Groening said that the measure of successful social criticism is "if you can delight half your audience and really annoy the hell out of the other half." Groening's tenth Life in Hell book, <i>The Huge Book of Hell,</i> works in much this way. Having evolved from a cynical, bitter outlook on life, <i>Life in Hell</i> now offers what is most likely the sharpest, most subversive social criticism available in comic strips. (Only Groening seems to be able to write things like "I have a constant craving for Jack Daniels" or "I'm going to tell God to stab you.") And, as such, it sometimes hits, it sometimes misses. What remains consistent is the quality of the insight, whether it be on the creative process, life's little burdens, family life, or the trials of love.Matt Groening is the genius behind The Simpsons and Futurama.

Reprint. $30,000 ad/promo.</p><p>DIXY LEE RAY (1914-1994) was a marine biologist. In 1973 she was appointed by Richard Nixon to chair the US Atomic Energy Commission, and was the first and only woman to do so.<br><br> LOU GUZZO is one of the most prolific writers of his day. Because of his penchant for writing, friends have dubbed Guzzo as a modern-day ''Grandpa Moses of Literature.''Some of the authors' major premises are that nuclear power is a safe and cheap source of energy; that acid rain is a vastly exaggerated problem; that chemical pesticides are not as dangerous as they have been made out to be; and that worry over the ozone hole is just an environmental scare tactic. Ray, a marine biologist, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Washington's governor when Mount St. Helens erupted, has a long history of offending conservationists, and most of this book, written with Guzzo, a writer and adviser to Ray during her governorship, is a recitation of statistics and research studies that prove her points. This recitation makes the book tedious, and it is troubling that there are no footnotes or bibliography. A researcher could spend weeks trying to search out the studies mentioned. Nevertheless, libraries may want this as an alternative to the growing mass of green literature.<br><i>- Sue McKimm, Cuya hoga Cty.

Such stories of environmental decline in the Maghreb are still recounted by experts and are widely accepted without question today. International organizations such as the United Nations frequently invoke these inaccurate stories to justify environmental conservation and development projects in the arid and semiarid lands in North Africa and around the Mediterranean basin. Recent research in arid lands ecology and new paleoecological evidence, however, do not support many claims of deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification in this region.<br><br>Diana K. Davis&#x2019;s pioneering analysis reveals the critical influence of French scientists and administrators who established much of the purported scientific basis of these stories during the colonial period in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, illustrating the key role of environmental narratives in imperial expansion. The processes set in place by the use of this narrative not only systematically disadvantaged the majority of North Africans but also led to profound changes in the landscape, some of which produced the land degradation that continues to plague the Maghreb today.<br><br><i>Resurrecting the Granary of Rome</i> exposes many of the political, economic, and ideological goals of the French colonial project in these arid lands and the resulting definition of desertification that continues to inform global environmental and development projects.

Benedetti's initial reluctance to intercede--overcome when he hears that somebody has mysteriously driven all the birds from bird-watching Henry's estate--presumably indicates that he knows what his creator, despite his protests to the contrary, has evidently forgotten: This case is outside his bailiwick. Fortunately, the banishing of the birds is followed by events the professor feels more at home with when Clyde is kidnapped and killed by a coy abductor, who strangles him less than an hour before his ice-cream maker nephew Chip arrives with the million-dollar ransom--and then doesn't even touch the money. One more last-minute murder, one adorable cat (brother Henry, of course, is a cat fancier), and no more mystery will follow. If you're counting clues, you'll find this puzzle ingenious, fair (almost too fair--it's easier to solve than the average crossword), but also so thinly imagined, it's instantly forgettable. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Even if Niccolo Benedetti, professor and self-styled expert on "Human Evil," often seems to be an agile, Mediterranean Nero Wolfe, this series remains notable for the ingenuity of DeAndrea's plotting and the quiet assurance of his prose. This latest case, following The Werewolf Murders , features several odd birds. The twin Pembroke brothers have lived all their lives together in rural Pennsylvania, amassing a fortune and occasionally feuding. Clyde loves bird watching; Henry raises and breeds tailless Manx cats. Both loved the same girl once, but Henry married her, and now his son Chip is building up an ice cream empire. The brothers have invented an air-cleaning device, but Clyde, whose beloved birds have fled the family estates (where a mysterious grape odor lingers in the still, birdless air), stands in the way of its manufacture. The mystery of the missing birds becomes the case of the abducted brother and then the case of the dead secretary. Niccolo, who also paints and likes to embellish his witty utterances with the occasional Italian flourish, does the intellectual digging, while PI Ron Gentry and his psychologist wife, Janet, take care of the grunt work. The threesome makes a charming team in this agreeably nutty case. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Damned Yankees: A No-Holds-Barred Account of Life With Boss Steinbrenner</h2><p>A behind-the-scenes look at the New York Yankees under the leadership of George Steinbrenner, describing the numerous managerial changes, trades, and life in the clubhouse</p><p>New York Daily News reporter Madden and Klein, of the Newark Star-Ledger , who have covered the Yankees for years, here join forces on a history that may send fans to their handkerchiefs and opponents into laughter. The authors chiefly discuss the period 1977 to 1989, when principal team owner George Steinbrenner converted a stable, conservative, successful franchise into a club characterized by "chaos, confusion, and craziness" to the point that some top players refuse to sign with the team. Control of the Yankees, argue Madden and Klein, has been ruled by the whims of a tyrant; as a result, the era they survey has seen 18 managers, 11 presidents, 10 PR agents and innumerable here-today, gone-tomorrow players. Such volatility makes for a rollicking though dismaying tale, related here with gusto.

This volume contributes to the unfinished task of moving beyond such polarities and dispelling the stereotypes they fostered, which have impeded scholars' ability to make sense of Brazil's rich indigenous past. </p><p>This volume is a significant contribution to understanding the ways Brazil's native peoples shaped their own histories. Incorporating the tools of anthropology, geography, cultural studies, and literary analysis, alongside those of history, the contributors revisit old sources and uncover new ones. They examine the Indians' first encounters with Portuguese explorers and missionaries and pursue the consequences through four centuries. Some of the peoples they investigate were ultimately defeated and displaced by the implacable advance of settlement. Many individuals died from epidemics, frontier massacres, and forced labor. Hundreds of groups eventually disappeared as distinct entities.

Through his own experience as the speechwriter for a controversial governor, Barton Swaim tells the story of a band of believers who attach themselves to this sort of ambitious narcissist&#x2014;and what happens when it all comes crashing down.<br> <br><i>The Speechwriter</i> is a funny and candid introduction to the world of politics, where press statements are purposefully nonsensical, grammatical errors are intentional, and better copy means more words. Swaim paints a portrait of a man so principled he&#x2019;d rather sweat than use state money to pay for air conditioning, so oblivious he&#x2019;d wear the same stained shirt for two weeks, so egotistical he&#x2019;d belittle his staffers to make himself feel better, and so self-absorbed he never once apologized to his staff for making his administration the laughing stock of the country. On the surface, this is the story of one politician&#x2019;s rise and fall. But in the end, it&#x2019;s a story about us&#x2014;the very real people who want to believe in our leaders and must learn to survive with broken hearts.</p><p>Barton Swaim, a native South Carolinian, attended the University of South Carolina and the University of Edinburgh. From 2007 to 2010 he worked for Mark Sanford, South Carolina&#x2019;s governor, as a communications officer and speechwriter. He lives in Columbia, South Carolina, with his wife, Laura, and three daughters, and writes regularly for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>. <i>The Speechwriter</i> is his first book.The Speechwriter <br> <br>1<br> <br>THE DUMPS<br> <br>About twenty of us sat in the conference room waiting for the boss to walk in. The room was warm and smelled faintly of sweat. A pair of law clerks quietly debated the correct pronunciation of &#x201c;debacle.&#x201d; At last Paul asked what the meeting was about. &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; June said, &#x201c;the governor wants to apologize to the staff.&#x201d; She said it with a wry look, but nobody laughed.<br> <br>Stewart looked up from a magazine. &#x201c;He already did that,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;He apologized to his mistress, and to his family&#x2014;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In that order,&#x201d; Paul said.<br> <br>Nervous laughter made its way around the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we can handle another apology,&#x201d; Stewart went on, throwing down the magazine. &#x201c;Because let me tell you, I know what an apology from this governor sounds like, and it ain&#x2019;t really an apology. It&#x2019;s more like&#x2014;.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused.<br> <br>Someone said, &#x201c;More like what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just put it this way. His apologies tend to have an unapologetic tone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another minute passed, and then the governor walked in. All went silent. He sat in the only remaining chair and made jokes with one of the interns.<br> <br>A week before, he had been openly talked about by influential commentators in New York and Washington as a presidential candidate. In national media reports, his name had been routinely used in conjunction with the terms &#x201c;principled stand,&#x201d; &#x201c;courageous,&#x201d; &#x201c;crazy,&#x201d; &#x201c;unbalanced,&#x201d; and &#x201c;interesting.&#x201d; The party&#x2019;s biggest donors had begun to call him and to pay him visits. Now he was the punch line to a thousand jokes; letters demanding his resignation appeared in newspapers; the word &#x201c;impeachment&#x201d; circulated through the capital like rumors of an assassination plot.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are y&#x2019;all?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Wait&#x2014;don&#x2019;t answer that.&#x201d;<br> <br>More nervous laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aahh.&#x201d; That was his preface to saying anything significant. &#x201c;Aahh. But that&#x2019;s why I called you in here. I just wanted to say the obvious, which is the obvious.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paul gave me a look of incomprehension.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, the obvious&#x2014;which is that I caused the storm we&#x2019;re now in. And that&#x2019;s made everything a little more difficult for everybody in here, and for that I want to say the obvious, which is that I apologize. But you know&#x201d;&#x2014;he rose up in his seat to an upright posture&#x2014;&#x201c;you know, I was telling one of the boys&#x201d;&#x2014;the governor had four sons&#x2014;&#x201c;this morning. We were up early and I was saying, &#x2018;Look, the sun came up today.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a beautiful thing to see. And it&#x2019;s a beautiful thing regardless of the storms of life. Of which this is one.&#x201d;<br> <br>People shifted in their seats and glanced at each other questioningly.<br> <br>&#x201c;As it happens,&#x201d; the governor went on, &#x201c;and before this storm started, I&#x2019;d been reading Viktor Frankl&#x2019;s book about being in a concentration camp. And it&#x2019;s just incredible to me how you can find beauty, you can find reasons to keep going, in the most appalling circumstances. And I just wanted to say to everybody, keep your head up. Keep pushing forward. And let&#x2019;s not be in the dumps here. The sun came up today. Aahh. We&#x2019;re not in a concentration camp. So let&#x2019;s not stay in the dumps. We can&#x2019;t make much progress on the important things if we&#x2019;re in the dumps. So if you&#x2019;re in the dumps, get out. I mean, of the dumps. Get out of the dumps.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nobody spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aahh. So, anybody want to say anything? Comments? Pearls of wisdom?&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no one spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, well&#x2014;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually I&#x2019;d like to say something.&#x201d; That was Stella.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to say&#x2014;. Actually maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; the governor smiled, &#x201c;go ahead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I think I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mm. Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>The governor walked out. Stewart looked around the room and said, &#x201c;For those of you who are newer to the office, that was the governor&#x2019;s version of a pep talk. Do you feel pepped?&#x201d;<br> <br>Later that afternoon I asked Stella what she&#x2019;d been intending to say. She had often told me that she didn&#x2019;t like her job&#x2014;her husband wanted her to keep it for the income&#x2014;and had often tried to get herself fired. I thought this might have been one of those times. She narrowed her eyes and pointed at me. &#x201c;You know what I was about to say? You really want to know? I was going to say, &#x2018;You know what, governor&#x2014;maybe what you say is true. Maybe we should be thankful that we&#x2019;re not in a concentration camp.&#x2019;&#x201d; You could hear a slight tremor in her voice. &#x201c;&#x2018;And maybe we take the sun rising for granted, and we shouldn&#x2019;t. But you&#x2019;re not really the one who should tell us that right now. And if you do say anything, it should be more like Sorry I flushed all your work down the toilet, people. Sorry I made you all a joke. Sorry about your next job interview, the one where you&#x2019;re going to be brought in as a curiosity and then laughed at.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stella, I wish you had said that.&#x201d;<br> <br>She had tears in her eyes.</p><h2>A Divine Confrontation</h2><p><p>The Church is in a season of profound change.

People crowded lecture halls to hear geologists speak, and parlor mineral cabinets signaled social respectability and intellectual engagement. This was also the heyday of the Hudson River School, and many prominent landscape painters avidly studied geology. Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, Frederic Church, John F. Kensett, William Stanley Haseltine, Thomas Moran, and other artists read scientific texts, participated in geological surveys, and carried rock hammers into the field to collect fossils and mineral specimens. As they crafted their paintings, these artists drew on their geological knowledge to shape new vocabularies of landscape elements resonant with moral, spiritual, and intellectual ideas.</p><br><p> Rebecca Bedell contributes to current debates about the relationship among art, science, and religion by exploring this phenomenon. She shows that at a time when many geologists sought to disentangle their science from religion, American artists generally sidestepped the era's more materialist science, particularly Darwinism. They favored a conservative, Christianized geology that promoted scientific study as a way to understand God. Their art was both shaped by and sought to preserve this threatened version of the science. And, through their art, they advanced consequential social developments, including westward expansion, scenic tourism, the emergence of a therapeutic culture, and the creation of a coherent and cohesive national identity.</p><br><p> This major study of the Hudson River School offers an unprecedented account of the role of geology in nineteenth-century landscape painting. It yields fresh insights into some of the most influential works of American art and enriches our understanding of the relationship between art and nature, and between science and religion, in the nineteenth century. It will draw a broad audience of art historians, Americanists, historians of science, and readers interested in the American natural landscape.</p></p><p><p>"Rebecca Bedell has unearthed a wealth of new material, and she has produced what will no doubt be the authoritative work on the subject for the foreseeable future. Her well-informed book is a major contribution to the understanding of Hudson River School landscape painting and the complex interrelationship between art and science in mid-nineteenth-century America."<b>--Alan Wallach, The College of William and Mary</b></p><p>"I unequivocally and enthusiastically recommend this book. It is an excellent piece of scholarship--thorough, well researched, richly nuanced. It presents an original and persuasive reinterpretation of ideas and images that have long been considered central to American cultural history. The chapters on Cole, Church, and Durand are full of fresh observations and fill in missing connections about the relationship between high culture, popular culture, and the burgeoning science of geology . . . There is no question that this is an important book, and a valuable addition to the study of nineteenth-century American landscape painting."<b>--Gray Sweeney, Arizona State University</b></p><b>Rebecca Bedell</b> is Assistant Professor in the Art Department at Wellesley College.</p><h2>RightStart Mathematics Level A Worksheets</h2><p>brand new Level A worksheets</p><p></p><h2>Information Please: Culture and Politics in the Age of Digital Machines</h2><p><i>Information Please</i> advances the ongoing critical project of the media scholar Mark Poster: theorizing the social and cultural effects of electronically mediated information. In this book Poster conceptualizes a new relation of humans to information machines, a relation that avoids privileging either the human or the machine but instead focuses on the structures of their interactions. Synthesizing a broad range of critical theory, he explores how texts, images, and sounds are made different when they are mediated by information machines, how this difference affects individuals as well as social and political formations, and how it creates opportunities for progressive change.<p></p><p>Poster&#x2019;s critique develops through a series of lively studies. Analyzing the appearance of <i>Sesame Street</i>&#x2019;s Bert next to Osama Bin Laden in a <i>New York Times</i> news photo, he examines the political repercussions of this Internet &#x201c;hoax&#x201d; as well as the unlimited opportunities that Internet technology presents for the appropriation and alteration of information. He considers the implications of open-source licensing agreements, online personas, the sudden rise of and interest in identity theft, peer-to-peer file sharing, and more. Focusing explicitly on theory, he reflects on the limitations of critical concepts developed before the emergence of new media, particularly globally networked digital communications, and he argues that, contrary to the assertions of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, new media do not necessarily reproduce neoimperialisms. Urging a rethinking of assumptions ingrained during the dominance of broadcast media, Poster charts new directions for work on politics and digital culture.</p></p><p>&#34;Mark Poster has been one of the foremost scholars of global digital culture over the past decades. &#34;Information Please,&#34; probably his best and most advanced book to date, continues his project of using contemporary theory to interrogate new media and new media to illustrate and critique certain forms of theory.&#34;--Douglas Kellner, coauthor of &#34;The Postmodern Adventure: Science, Technology, and Cultural Studies at the Third Millennium&#34;<p>Mark Poster is Professor of History and of Film and Media Studies at the University of California, Irvine.

Despite a military career that included distinguished service in Europe and North Africa, Ross is better known for his actions than his name: his 1814 campaign in the Chesapeake Bay resulted in the burning of the White House and Capitol and the unsuccessful assault on Baltimore, immortalized in &#x201c;The Star Spangled Banner.&#x201d; <i>The Man Who Captured Washington</i> is the first in-depth biography of this important but largely forgotten historical figure.<br><br> Drawing from a broad range of sources, both British and American, military historians John McCavitt and Christopher T. George provide new insight into Ross&#x2019;s career prior to his famous exploits at Washington, D.C. Educated in Dublin, Ross joined the British Army in 1789, earning steady promotion as he gained combat experience. The authors portray him as an ambitious but humane commanding officer who fought bravely against Napoleon&#x2019;s forces on battlefields in Holland, southern Italy, Egypt, and the Iberian Peninsula. Following the end of the war in Europe, while still recovering from a near-fatal wound, Ross was designated to lead an &#x201c;enterprise&#x201d; to America, and in August 1814 he led a small army to victory in the Battle of Bladensburg. From there his forces moved to the city of Washington, where they burned public buildings. In detailing this campaign, McCavitt and George clear up a number of misconceptions, including the claim that the British burned the entire city of Washington. Finally, the authors shed new light on the long-debated circumstances surrounding Ross&#x2019;s death on the eve of the Battle of North Point at Baltimore.<br><br> Ross&#x2019;s campaign on the shores of the Chesapeake lasted less than a month, but its military and political impact was enormous. Considered an officer and a gentleman by many on both sides of the Atlantic, the general who captured Washington would in time fade in public memory. Yet, as McCavitt and George show, Ross&#x2019;s strategies and achievements during the final days of his career would shape American defense policy for decades to come.</p><p><b>John McCavitt </b>is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

He is the author of <i>Terror on the Chesapeake: The War of 1812 on the Bay</i>.&#x201c;Following distinguished commands in Iberia and France under the Duke of Wellington, Major General Robert Ross arrived in the Chesapeake in 1814 and quickly earned distinction as &#x2018;Ross of Bladensburg&#x2019; following his victory over American forces near Washington, D.C. But when he became known almost exclusively as the British commander who burned Washington, his reputation was eclipsed&#x2014;until now. John McCavitt and Christopher T. George have rescued Ross from obscurity to show what an effective commander he was in both the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>John R. Grodzinski</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Defender of Canada: Sir George Prevost and the War of 1812</i><br><br>&#x201c;This superbly researched book will become the definitive history of the life of British Major General Robert Ross&#x2014;a little-known and underappreciated figure of great importance to the War of 1812. Ross was not only a first-rate combat commander but also the only former subordinate of Wellington to succeed in independent command against the Americans on their home soil&#x2014;most notably at the pivotal battle of Bladensburg and his subsequent capture of nearby Washington, D.C.

In a delightfully witty style, Labro poses a traditional European upbringing against the equally narrow rituals of Southern society in 1954-55. Ignoring the similarities, the nameless narrator revels in American differences: the college's unwritten dress code, male friendships that lead to future wealth and power, the significant convertible, Fats Domino and rock 'n roll, and, of course, American women. His first relationship is with April, a black maid. In a revealing analysis of 1950s race relations, the narrator finds himself walking a thin line between his love for a forbidden woman and his desire to be accepted by segregated Southern society. In contrast, his second girlfriend is Elizabeth, a co-ed in the midst of rebelling against her monied Bostonian parents who would have her star in high society. He is unable to understand her rejection of a realm of which he has grown enamored. Labro's third novel successfully captures, through the eyes of an outsider, the essence of the American collegiate rites of passage that were all-important in the 1950s. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>John Brown: The Making of a Martyr (Southern Classics Series)</h2><p>Warren's first book, a biography that foreshadows the themes developed in novels like <i>All the King's Men</i>, portrays the flawed idealist whose violent seizure of the Harper's Ferry arsenal led to the greater violence of the Civil War.

It is dark, thus his terror is irrational; even if he wanted to, he could not make out what he's done, let alone note the gruesome details. Still, his mind's eye insists on the scene: gory, explicit, final. Imagination, not remorse, is at the core of his violent hysteria.<br><br>Within the hour he will exhaust himself and even fall asleep for a few minutes. When he wakes - with a start - reason will return and bring with it a degree of fatalism. Two paths now lie before him, and the choice is no longer his. He will pick himself up, carefully not look- ing over the edge. He will right his clothing, inspect his hands with care, and return home. And then he will wait to see what the future holds.<br>And he will vow to reveal the truth - but only at the time of his death.<br>One<br><br>Saturday, 2 July<br>St. John's Wood, London<br><br>The freedoms of being a boy, reflected Mary, were many. She could swing her arms as she walked. She could run if she wished. She looked tidy enough to avoid police suspi- cion but shabby enough to be invisible to all others. Then there was the odd sensation of lightness that came of having cropped hair; she hadn't realized how heavy her own hair was until it was gone. Her breasts were tightly bound, and even if they did ache a little at such treatment, she could at least scratch herself with impunity, scratch- ing in public being one of those Boy Things she ought to enjoy while she could. It was therefore a shame that she wasn't enjoying the situation. Wearing boy's clothing was comfortable and amusing, and she'd enjoyed her esca- pades in breeches during her first-ever assignment. But this - today - was entirely different. It was serious, and she still had no idea why.<br><br>Her instructions were simple enough: to costume her self as a twelve-year-old boy and attend a meeting of the Agency at three o'clock this afternoon. No further expla- nation had been offered, and by now, Mary knew better than to ask for more details. Anne and Felicity always gave precisely as much information as they deemed appropri- ate. Of course, such knowledge hadn't stopped her from fretting about the possibilities yesterday, overnight, and all this morning. Over the past year, she'd delighted in her training: tests, lessons, and brief assignments that offered a taste of the life to come. But there was little pleasure in her this morning. What did Anne and Felicity want? And what sort of assignment could be connected with her present guise?<br><br>The Agency had been created and was staffed entirely by women, and its genius lay in the exploitation of female stereotypes. Its secret agents disguised themselves as maids, governesses, clerks, lady companions, and other humble, powerless characters. In most situations, no mat- ter how dangerous, few people would suspect a subservi- ent woman of being intelligent and observant, let alone a professional spy. With this as the Agency's guiding philosophy, it made no sense whatsoever for Mary to be dressed as a boy.<br><br>She raked her fingers through her hair, then stopped abruptly midstroke: that was a girl's gesture. And the only thing worse than not understanding what she was doing was compounding it by doing a poor job, too. As she neared the top of Acacia Road, where the Agency was headquartered, Mary pressed her lips together and took several deep breaths. Her cowardly impulse was to turn and make one last circuit of Regent's Park, to spend just a little more time thinking matters through. As though she hadn't already been marching about St. John's Wood for the past two hours. As though physical movement might still her mind and soothe her nerves. As though she was calm enough to sort through the swirl of emotions cloud- ing her brain.<br><br>It was time to act, not to think. A few brisk steps took her to the house with its wrought-iron gates and polished brass nameplate: MI S S SCR I M SH AW'S ACADEM Y FOR GI RLS. The Academy had been her home for years now. But today, looking at the nameplate, she willed herself to look at it as a stranger might - specifically, as a twelve-year-old boy might. The house was large and well kept, with a tidy garden and flagged path. But in contrast with those of the neighboring houses, the front steps were swept but not whitened - an essential task that proclaimed to the world that one kept servants and kept them busy rewhitening the steps each time a caller marred them with footprints. The Academy's irregularity here was the only sign of the most unusual institution that lay within.<br><br>Suddenly, the front door swung open and disgorged a pair of girls - or, rather, young ladies. They were neatly dressed, neither at the height of fashion nor in the depths of dowdiness. They were having an animated conversa- tion. And they looked curiously at Mary, whose nose was still inches from the closed gate.<br> <br>"Are you lost?" asked the taller of the two as they approached the gate.<br>Mary shook her head. "No, miss." Her voice came out higher than she wanted, and she cleared her throat hast- ily. "I was bid come here."<br>A fine wrinkle appeared on the girl's forehead. "By whom?"<br>"I mean, I've a letter to deliver."<br><br>The girl held out her hand. "Then you may give it to me."<br>Mary shook her head again. "Can't, miss. I'm charged to give it to Mrs. Frame and no one else. Is this her house?" She'd spent all morning working on her inflection, trying to get the accent right while keeping her voice gruff.<br><br>The girl looked imperious. "You may trust me; I'm the head girl at this Academy."</p><h2>Utopia (Selected Works of St. Thomas More Series)</h2><p>Based on Volume 4 of the Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More, this edition includes an Introduction and Notes by Father Surtz.&nbsp; The accuracy of the translation ensures that the volume can be used by the historian, literary scholar, the social and political scientist, and the student of utopian thought.</p><p><i>The Life of Thomas More</i> is Peter Ackroyd's biography--from baptism to beheading--of the lawyer who became a saint. More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism. His complex and ironic account of an imaginary communist society has not only given rise to the genre of utopian fiction but has been an inspiration to generations of political reformers.</p><h2>What the Bible Says About God the Redeemer</h2><p>What the bible says about God.</p><p>Cottrell is Professor of Theology at Cincinnati Bible College and Seminary.</p><h2>Hawke: The definitive biography</h2><p>Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

He offers precise yet evocative accounts of the diverse lives and events within the forested portion of the ecosystem, such as the habits of deer mice who help re-seed the burned earth, the seemingly accidental but vitally necessary symbiotic associations between fungus and tree root tips that stimulate and maintain growth, the constant predation among wildlife that joins life to death to life, and a host of other miraculously and mysteriously interlocking life cycles. He shows how over the course of a millennium, &#34;microbes and fungi change a forest just as surely as a ranging fire, only inconspiculously and more slowly.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The peoples of the hills: ancient Ararat and Caucasus (History of civilization)</h2><p>It's one of the most exciting areas of archeology today: the ancient history of eastern Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, and the Caucasus in the third and second millennia B.C.

Meanwhile, kids can remove related paraphernalia from Mommy's briefcase-in this case, glasses and address book. A cardboard sandwich and apple serve as lunch on the run, while a change purse displays the coins used "to buy a cold drink from the juice machine." Other items include the morning paper (the Newsy Times, with headlines and pictures but no copy) a desktop picture of Mommy's offspring, etc. Aliki's animal cast is perky and personable, though she leans heavily on puns in background art: the Times includes a Meaosic section and Meous and Views column, while one of the company's models is pictured as a Cossack, or "Rushin' Bear." Still, many amusing touches make this book a candidate for repeated readings and a playful introduction to the working world.

Five previously unpublished stories have recently been discovered, and this new volume brings together all of his uncollected fiction, including a fragment of an unfinished novel, five early stories, and all of his non-fiction prose. Three of these late-found stories are fine examples of Carver&#39;s late, open style, while two date from his middle period. The non-fiction prose includes all of his essays, together with occasional commentary on his own fiction and poetry, writings on the American short story, and reviews of work by his contemporaries, among them Donald Barthelme, Richard Brautigan, Jim Harrison, Thomas McGuane and Richard Ford. Also included is Carver&#39;s latest essay &#34;Friendship&#34;, about a London reunion with Richard Ford and Tobias Wolff. Call If You Need Me takes us into Carver&#39;s workshop, and alongside All of Us: The Collected Poems and Where I&#39;m Calling from: The Selected Stories completes the picture of one of the most original writers in the English language of his generation.</p><p>Raymond Carver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, in 1938. His father was a saw-mill worker and his mother was a waitress and clerk. He married early and for years writing had to come second to earning a living for his young family. Despite, small-press publication, it was not until Will You Please Be Quiet Please? appeared in 1976 that his work began to reach a wider audience. This was the year in which he gave up alcohol, which had contributed to the collapse of his marriage. In 1977 he met the writer Tess Gallagher, with whom he shared the last eleven years of his life. During this prolific period he wrote three collections of stories, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Cathedral and Elephant. Fires, a collection of essays, poems and stories, appeared in 1985, followed by three further collections of poetry. He completed the poetry collection A New Path to the Waterfall shortly before his death in 1988.&#34;Raymond Carver has done what many of the most gifted writers fail to do, he has invented a country of his own&#34; -- Michael Wood * New York Times * &#34;The prose is a prayer book of simple words, unsentimental.

When two childhood friends die of cancer six weeks apart, the shared experience of loss brings their grieving spouses together. After months of late-night phone calls, family dinners, and countless dreams and tears, this unlikely pair builds a trust, a love, and a shared life. Told from alternating points of view, The Color of Rain illuminates the stepping-stones of healing that lead to a joyful new beginning for Michael and Gina Spehn and their five children. Like many who grieve, Michael and Gina had to choose to hope again. Along the way, they discovered that God can restore the darkest circumstances&#x2015;and even from death, He can bring new life. Michael and Gina&#x2019;s gripping story of &#x201c;growing new hearts&#x201d; will inspire readers not only to survive loss but also to receive the new courage, faith, and identity that God gives in the midst of tragedy.</p></p><p>Michael Spehn is husband, father, high school basketball coach, and now author.

Today&#x2019;s concerns&#x2014;internationalism, education, the future of labor, the status of art, and ecological theory and practice&#x2014;frame and inform her carefully researched restaging of the words and actions of individual Communards. This original analysis of an event and its centrifugal effects brings to life the workers in Paris who became revolutionaries, the significance they attributed to their struggle, and the elaboration and continuation of their thought in the encounters that transpired between the insurrection&#x2019;s survivors and supporters like Marx, Kropotkin, and William Morris.<br><br> The Paris Commune was a laboratory of political invention, important simply and above all for, as Marx reminds us, its own &#x201c;working existence.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>Communal Luxury</i> allows readers to revisit the intricate workings of an extraordinary experiment.</p><p><b>Kristin Ross</b> is a professor of comparative literature at New York University.

Ross&#x2019;s vision of the Commune extends beyond the 72 days, and beyond the space of Paris (and indeed of France), to encompass its echoes throughout the rest of the 19th century ... For Ross, the story of the Commune is not a tragedy, because it is not finished.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;<i>Communal Luxury</i> is a rich and complex book. It is an inspired rereading of the Paris Commune. It is a critique of historical accounts that ignore the ways in which the practices of insurrectionary movements generate their own theory. It is a call to historians to attend to the alternatives offered at decisive moments of political and economic consolidation. It is, as well, Ross&#x2019;s own manifesto about how we might think our futures differently. This is a history with enormous relevance for our contemporary political moment.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Joan W. Scott, Institute For Advanced Study, Princeton</b><br><br>&#x201c;Ross argues that the spirit of the Commune is alive today among ... the Indignados in Spain and inside the Occupy movement [and] discusses the &#x2018;political imaginary&#x2019; that fuelled and outlived the Commune.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Philippe Marli�re, <i>London Review of Books</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;A timely, elegant and rather useful cartography of the Paris Commune ...

Wherever they settled, the Irish founded churches and community organizations, became active in politics, and held St. Patrick&#39;s Day parades, inviting all Minnesotans to become a little bit Irish.

Fans remember his memorable career in New York, capsuled by two remarkable, yet polar-opposite games. The highest of highs would be his triumphant dunk over Horace Grant and Michael Jordan, known in Knick history as &#34;The Dunk,&#34; in the waning moments of the 1993 Eastern Conference Finals against the Chicago Bulls which put the Knicks up two games to none. Starks also holds nothing back about his 2-for-18 shooting drought in Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets, which was the last real chance the Knicks have had for a championship since 1973. Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason, Mark Jackson, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy are all seen anew through Starks&#39; clear, no-nonsense eyes. Starks also describes his other NBA stops in Golden State, Utah and, briefly, Chicago. In addition, Starks names his all-minor league-to-NBA team, his all-heart-on-the-jersey team and his all-shooting team. Starks&#39; autobiography describes the star&#39;s rise from life in inner-city Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a child, John did not escape trouble, stealing from stores and later cars with a friend who later died in a high-speed car crash with the police. He credits his escape and rapid rise to the influence of his older brother, Monry, who watched the majority of John&#39;s NBA career from behind bars, and the single mother that raised John and his siblings. John later attended four junior colleges before making his breakthrough and playing Division I college basketball at Oklahoma State. Montry,before he was sent away to prison, was the one who drove John, toughening him up in savage games of one-on-one and convincing John that he had more in him than just being a drug dealer like himself and playing basketball on the playgrounds of Tulsa. It was Monty who called Leonard Hamilton, the then-coach of Oklahoma State, and got Coach Hamilton to come down and watch John play at Oklahoma Junior College, resulting in a scholarship. Finally, it is a book about family and Starks moving back to Tulsa and raising his family of three children (John Jr. is an aspiring basketball player with a dream to make it to the NBA like his father) with his wife, Jackie, and helping Monty after his release from prison in 2000. Montry now lives in a house on John&#39;s property, adjacent to John&#39;s house, and has helped him find employment. The two are avid golf partners who, although they constantly fight over everything from Montry rooting for OU and John for OSU, share a bond forged on the hardscrabble streets of North Tulsa.</p><p>Spike Lee is one of the most prominent and influential media figures today.

His biggest influence was his older brother, Monty, who witnessed from a jail cell most of his kid brother's rise from playground star to NBA headliner. But it was Monty who engineered John's first break by convincing a Division I school coach to scout John in one of his junior-college games, which paved the way for a scholarship to Oklahoma State. Starks shares stories and opinions about many of his fellow Knicks players and about Pat Riley, his NBA coach for most of his career, and happily recounts his favorite moments, including "the Dunk," his legendary stuff shot over the heads of the Chicago Bull's Michael Jordan and Horace Grant in the 1993 NBA playoffs. The book contains a 16-page pictorial and is accompanied by a DVD that features an interview with Starks (neither seen by the reviewer).

It is obviously a good thing-until one starts to think about the meaning of the term and its implications. Then it shows itself to be an idea that polarizes, encouraging uncritical support and also extreme reaction from both secularists and religionists. John Warwick Montgomery, who is both a lawyer and a theologian, is uniquely qualified to address the question of human rights. In clear, easily understood language, he analyzes what human rights are and addresses the crucial question, &#34;How can human rights, properly understood, be legitimated?&#34; Montgomery shows that is there is a foundation for human rights, it must be sought in a transcendent perspective, in the revelational content of the Bible.John Warwick Montgomery is Professor Emeritus of Law and Humanities at the University of Luton, England. Professor Montgomery holds eight earned degrees besides the LL.B.: the A.B. with distinction in Philosophy (Cornell University; Phi Beta Kappa), B.L.S. and M.A. (University of California at Berkeley), B.D. and S.T.M. (Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio), M. Phil. in Law (University of Essex, England), Ph.D. (University of Chicago), and the Doctorat d&#39;Universit from Strasbourg, France. Before moving to the United Kingdom, he served on the faculty of the University of Chicago and was Chairman of the Department of History at Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada. He is a barrister-at-law of the Middle Temple and Lincoln&#39;s Inn, England; member of the California, Virginia, Washington State, and District of Columbia Bars and the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States Dr. Montgomery is the author of over one hundred scholarly journal articles and more than forty books in English, French, Spanish and German.</p><h2>The Gallows Curse</h2><p>1210 and a black force is sweeping England. For a vengeful King John has seized control of the Church, leaving corpses to lie in unconsecrated ground, babies unbaptized in their cradles and the people terrified of dying in sin. And in the village of Gastmere, the consequences grow darker still when Elena, a servant girl, is dragged into a conspiracy to absolve the sins of the lord of the manor. As the terrors that soon begin to plague Elena&#39;s sleep grow darker, in desperation she visits the cunning woman, who has been waiting for just such an opportunity to fulfil an ancient curse conjured at the gallows. Elena, haunted by this curse and threatened with death for a crime she didn&#39;t commit, flees the village ...only to find her nightmare has barely begun. For treachery lurks in every shadow as King John&#39;s brutal reign makes enemies of brothers, murderers of virgins and sinners of us all.</p><p>Karen Maitland travelled and worked in many parts of the United Kingdom before finally settling in the beautiful medieval city of Lincoln.

From 1982 to 1988 he was chief investigator and co-director of the Philadelphia Police/FBI Organized Crime Task Force in Philadelphia. He was guest lecturer for the FBI on the problems of organized crime, serves as a consultant to Major League Baseball on organized crime, and teaches courses about organized crime at LaSalle College and St. Joseph and Temple Universities. He travels around the country assessing the professional standards of police departments on behalf of the National Commission on Accreditation. Friel retired from the Philadelphia Police Department in 1989 to take a position of Director of Public Safety in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. In 1997, he started Atlantic Security International Investigations, a division of Atlantic Security Inc., where he currently serves as president.John Guinther is a Philadelphia-based author and journalist. Three of his articles have been cited for excellence by the American Bar Association. He is the winner of the Robert F. Kennedy and Gerald Loeb awards. He has written six other books. Guinther&#39;s articles on the Ferber case were nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1986. The same year, he was awarded the Louis Apotheker citation for the advancement of the cause of justice by a non-lawyer. Another of his books, Brotherhood of Murder, written with Thomas Martinez, has been filmed by Showtime, starring William Baldwin, and is also available through iUniverse.com. His most recent book is Direction of Cities (Viking/Penguin, 1997).A former Philadelphia police captain who rose through the ranks and headed his city's Organized Crime Task Force, Friel played a major role in the breakup of the Nicky Scarfo Mafia family. The Scarfo mob, originally based in the City of Brotherly Love, expanded its focus to include Atlantic City when legalized gambling was approved for the seaside resort. Scarfo, a violent and unpredictable man, had taken over after his two predecessors were murdered within a year; his ascendance set off a wave of killings. Collaborating with Guinther ( Brotherhood of Murder ), Friel tells how police work brought the don and dozens of his underlings to justice in 1989. The book also details Friel's own successful effort to free a wrongly convicted man from death row. But what makes the book especially noteworthy are the authors' insights into the psychology of mobsters and their recommendations for increased efficiency in fighting the drug war, especially interagency cooperation. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Coastal Journey</h2><p>In this breathtaking travelogue, photographer Kathy Fallon guides readers on a magical, inspirational journey through some of America&#x2019;s most beloved coastlines and coastlands&#x2014;from the Wildwoods and Cape May in southern New Jersey to the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

Judaism began a few thousand years before that. Religion in Egypt and Sumer go maybe a few thousand years before that. <br>But what came before? Most people don't know that civilization began at Sind, a fertile area in modern Pakistan. Their ancient religion, the worship of Shiva and Shakti, is the oldest religion known. It spread throughout the world and it, reactions to it, or a combination of the two are the basis for all religion in the world today. <br>Does this sound surprising? Historian and former history teacher Ann Moura has been able to trace civilization and religion into the past by over 100,000 years! She presents this information in <i>Origins of Modern Witchcraft. <br></i>The author reveals that virtually every aspect of modern Witchcraft can be traced back to the ancient Sind religion. Much of the same can be found in modern Hinduism, but Hinduism has had many Vedic ideas &#x2013; including orthodoxy and caste &#x2013; added to the original faith. <br>Even so, the notion of the triple goddess (a Maiden, Mother, and Crone) comes straight from the older religion. The idea of the God being horned is derived from an image of Shiva. Many of the mythic images we associate with Greece and Rome originally came from the Sind religion. <br>But this goes beyond Wicca to other religions. You'll see that Christ was a version of Krishna and "original sin" was a development of those who hated the original religion. It means that something was evil because it originally came from Sind. <br>Controversial? You bet! This book is destined to be one of the most controversial books published this or any other year!

Its roots are sunk deep in the shamanistic and naturalistic expressions of universal interconnection found in the earliest known spiritual traditions of humankind. Over time, the Craft evolved to reflect, and deflect, changes in society, economy, politics, and the new religions that supported these innovations. Through all these alterations, the Old Religion never lost its deeper awareness of the interrelationship of all life on Earth and our place among the stars.</p> <p> Awareness of the motion of universal bodies such as meteors and comets; conscious of nebulas, galaxies, black holes, and the possibility of life on other planets we look at exploring all force us to realize that we can no longer consider ourselves isolated from the rest of the universe. Our need to recognize that we are part of the greater patterns of universal life is what turns us back to the natural spirituality and practical wisdom of our ancestors, intellectually updated, and grounded in the scientific realities of our world. The Old Religion was never intended to be irrational, but is a rational expression of the universe as it was rationally and spiritually known at the time. Witchcraft and Wicca are, after all, the root words for science (German) and wisdom (Anglo-Saxon). The unification of the mind and the spirit with the body is what makes the practitioner of the Craft a whole being.</p> <p> Witchcraft has evolved over time, adapting to the changes of societies and cultures, finding resistance and persecution with the formation of unfriendly and unsympathetic political bodies, yet persevering nevertheless because the truths of the ancient forces are everlasting and immanent. Today, the ogham symbol &#x201c;straif,&#x201d; the blackthorn: strife, that has for so long been representative of the situation of the Craft and the practitioners of the Craft, is being turned around to become the whitethorn: overcoming coercion. Political forces are now being turned around to grant legal and judicial support to the followers of this most ancient of spiritual paths.</p> <p> To find our Pagan roots, we need to walk backward through time, sorting through the cultural and social changes, the political statements, the actions of protest and desperation, to find the distilled central core of the Old Religion. This is the trek of the Seeker&#x2015;a life-long path, first walked backward, in order to turn around and move forward with renewed vigor. To find the lost heritage, identify its threads, and trace those threads back to the present, we need to go as far back in our history as we currently can&#x2015;to our very beginnings.</p> <p> Human history is reevaluated with each generation, and often the result is colored by the political, cultural, social, and religious demands of the time period. The study of deciphering what is real and what is format is addressed in the field of historiography, and it is through this means that the threads of history might be unraveled for the Seeker. When politics and religion combine, as has been the case in western history for over a thousand years, education and knowledge suffer. The Seeker must be especially diligent in pursuit of wisdom, and look beyond the ordinary texts found in schools for mass consumption. Instead, research is the means for striking out on a new path. The recent discoveries of various archeaologists and historians must be hunted down if we want to find the true origins of civilization. We are left to take up our lantern like the Hermit of the tarot cards, to seek out the path, and perhaps light the way for those who follow. This ninth card of the Major Arcana of the tarot is often portrayed with a robed aesthetic, a staff in one hand and a lantern in the other held up to light the way to a new path he creates, diverging from a more traveled one.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Rocks and Minerals</h2><p>The rocks and minerals beneath our feet are often ignored, overlooked or misunderstood.

They were heard regularly in the homes of our principal statesmen, authors, intellectuals, professionals, and businessmen. Laborers and slaves also sang them. They were the principal fare of concert and stage performances, and were freely interpolated into Italian operas, Shakespearean plays, lyceum lectures, and church services. In short, parlor songs played a dominant role in American cultural history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the music that Jefferson, Lincoln, Longfellow, Whitman, and Emily Dickinson enjoyed. Yet, whether owing to prejudice or misinformation, we still know little about the songs they listened to and sang: why and for whom written; when heard; or how performed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book attempts to contribute that knowledge. Contemporary diaries, biographies, fiction, newspapers, periodicals, and books on music were studied and the music itself exhaustively analyzed in order to reach accurate conclusions about the popular culture that emerged between the American Revolution and the Civil War.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reader comes away with a sympathetic understanding of the human hopes, fears, and joys embodied in the songs, and with a curiosity about the countless melodic gems awaiting exploration.</p></p><p><p>Nicholas Tawa was born in Boston and is professor of music at the University of Massachusetts, Boston campus. He has studied the popular-music culture of America for over twenty-five years and has written a Harvard Ph. D. dissertation and numerous published articles on the subject. He was also cofounder of the Sonneck Society, in 1974, and through this organization has fought to promote the performance of, and to encourage serious research in, American music. For the last six years he has been First Vice-President of that society and the editor of the newsletter.</p></p><h2>These Are the Gifts I&#39;d Like to Give to You: A Sourcebook of Joy and Encouragement</h2><p>"Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open every door." - Emily Dickinson <p>"And all the windows of my heart I open to the day." - John Greenleaf Whittier </p><p>Filled with the most meaningful gifts that could ever be given, this book is a rare and wonderful collection.

This second novel in his planned trilogy continues the chilling drama of life in the Soviet Union just after Khrushchev&#39;s purge of Stalin in 1956. Protagonist Leo Demidov is an ex-security officer during a time when it is dangerous to have been one of Stalin&#39;s minions. Now working as a homicide detective, Demidov is being threatened by the wife of a Russian Orthodox priest, whom he was responsible for imprisoning in the old days. Now the priest&#39;s wife has every intention of killing Demidov&#39;s daughter if he does not get her husband released from the gulag. Dennis Boutsikaris&#39;s Russian accents are superb.

Their great offensives against Germany had been calamitous, leaving hundreds of thousands of young men dead and wounded for negligible territorial gains. Despite America&#39;s entry into the war the US army remained tiny, the Italian army had been routed, and Russia had dropped out of the conflict. The Central Powers now dominated Central and Eastern Europe, and Germany could move over forty divisions to the Western Front. Yet only one year later, on 11 November 1918, the fighting ended in a decisive Allied victory. In his new book David Stevenson retells the story of the final year of the First World War and, in a remarkable and fascinating piece of original research, goes to the roots of this dramatic reversal of fortune, analysing the reasons for Allied success and the collapse of Germany and its partners. Everything from food supply to finance, from strategy to technology, logistics, and morale, is explored in an assessment that lays bare the nerve-racking decisions taken on both sides and the sheer uncertainty faced by the leaders. Ironically Stevenson traces Germany&#39;s 1918 disaster to &#39;Operation Michael&#39;, the great spring offensive that tested the British army to the uttermost and led on to Field Marshal Haig&#39;s famous &#39;With our backs to the wall&#39; order to his troops to fight to the last man. This is a rich and compelling study of a turning point in modern history. The consequences of the events of 1918 shaped the whole of the twentieth century - and still touch us today.</p><p>David Stevenson is a Professor of International History at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and author of the highly praised 1914-1918: The History of the First World War: &#39;Momentous... this history of the conflict surpasses all others&#39;, Independent; &#39;Superb&#39;, Ian Kershaw; &#39;David Stevenson is the real deal&#39;, Niall Ferguson; &#39;The best comprehensive one-volume history of the war yet written&#39;, New YorkerA magnificent and exhaustive account of the war&#39;s final year ...

Wilkes first read the Little House books as a young girl and has been fascinated by pioneer history ever since. She did extensive research on the Quiner, Ingalls, and Wilder families, studied original sources and family letters and diaries, and worked in close consultation with several historians and the Laura Ingalls Wilder estate as she wrote the Caroline Years books. She lives in New Jersey with her husband, Peter, and her daughters, Grace and Natalie.paper 0-06-026998-7 The family of Laura Ingalls Wilder is marketed practically to death with the appearance of another entry in the Little House/The Caroline Years series: Caroline, Laura's mother, is a child moving with her family to the Wisconsin woods. Wilkes is less concerned with characterization than in getting the family from one place to another, and settled in their new home. A description of their disastrous first crop is quickly followed by a solution to their threat of hunger. Hints of the characters' qualities peek through, as when Caroline wonders if ``some new person'' is ``stuck inside'' her increasingly fastidious sister. A flash of an argument between them brings the book temporarily to life, but it quickly settles back into a carefully planned script, charting a path from the move until the courtship of Caroline's mother, a widow. It's a genial volume, but can't hold a candle to Wilder's vividly evoked pioneer days, nor even to Roger Lea MacBride's Little House episodes about Rose Wilder (Little Farm in the Ozarks, 1994, etc.).

Julia also writes children&#x2019;s plays and songs, and runs regular storytelling workshops. She lives in Glasgow with her husband, Malcolm, and their family.PreS-Gr. 1. George, a giant, buys a spiffy new wardrobe to replace his worn, patched gown and sandals. Soon he strides through town and country, singing to himself and helping those he meets along the way. He gives his tie to a giraffe with a cold neck, one of his shoes to a mouse for a home, and his belt to help a dog who keeps sinking in a muddy bog. When his unbelted pants fall down (a sight that will provoke hoots and giggles from the story hour set), George realizes that he's cold. Once he finds his old clothes and his new friends again, he's warm both inside and out. George's song, which becomes longer each time he sings it, functions as a cumulative reflection of his good deeds and a rhythmic, rhyming break from the prose text. Children will find this an appealing tale, with especially nice art. Scheffler creates an unabashedly childlike, imaginary land where clothed animals, people, and giants peacefully coexist. Amusing details abound in the lively, colorful illustrations. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He's been "invited" to attend a royal function as both detective and diplomat. The one role he relishes; the other requires, well, ruby tights. Of course where cops (even those clad in tights) go, alas, crime follows. An attempted assassination and a theft soon lead to a desperate chase from the low halls of Discworld royalty to the legendary fat mines of Uberwald, where lard is found in underground seams along with tusks and teeth and other precious ivory artifacts. It's up to the dauntless Vimes -- bothered as usual by a familiar cast of Discworld inhabitants (you know, trolls, dwarfs, werewolves, vampires and such) -- to solve the puzzle of the missing pachyderm. Which of course he does. After all, solving mysteries <i>is</i> his job.</p></p><p>Terry Pratchett has a seemingly endless capacity for generating inventively comic novels about the Discworld and its inhabitants, but there is in the hearts of most of his admirers a particular place for those novels that feature the hard-bitten captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, Samuel Vimes. Sent as ambassador to the Northern principality of Uberwald where they mine gold, iron, and fat--but never silver--he is caught up in an uneasy truce between dwarfs, werewolves, and vampires in the theft of the Scone of Stone (a particularly important piece of dwarf bread) and in the old werewolf custom of giving humans a short start in the hunt and then cheating.<p> Pratchett is always at his best when the comedy is combined with a real sense of jeopardy that even favorite characters might be hurt if there was a good joke in it. As always, the most unlikely things crop up as the subjects of gags--Chekhov, grand opera, the Caine Mutiny--and as always there are remorselessly funny gags about the inevitability of story: </p><p> </p><blockquote>They say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains. <p> No one actually saw it land, which raised the interesting philosophical question: when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky, and there is no one to hear it, does it--philosophically speaking--make a noise? </p><p> As for the dwarfs, whose legend it is, and who mine a lot deeper than other people, they say that there is a grain of truth in it.</p></blockquote><p> All this, the usual guest appearances, and Gaspode the Wonder Dog. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>Terry Pratchett is one of the most popular authors writing today.

As before, the authors-famous and little-known, contemporary and ancient-are not necessarily gay, but do depict a broad range of homosexual experience. Many of the names are expected and welcome: Gide, Mishima, Cocteau, Puig. Wisely, Mann's "Death in Venice" is reprinted in its entirety (in a fine new translation by David Luke). By contrast, more than three-quarters of the entries are excerpts from longer works and thus suffer from a sense of incompleteness. In addition, a provocative thread running through many pieces dwells on the carnal fulfillment men find with boys, most notably in an excerpt from Tony Duvert's When Jonathan Died, about a man's physical relationship with a sexually precocious pre-adolescent. Also represented are Barthes, Balzac, Boccaccio, Yourcenar and Camus. Plato attests to the normalcy of homosexual desire. Freud deconstructs one of Leonardo's childhood memories to explore the Italian's homosexuality. Erotic responses to the martyrdom of St. Sebastian and to Christ occur several times, and an appreciation of sadomasochism is traced in several works, including the writings of the Marquis himself. Most rewarding are two short stories debuting in English: "An Angel at Orsay," by Patrick Drevet about a sensual encounter in the Musee d'Orsay, and "Mona," by Cuban Reinaldo Arenas. In the latter, Leonardo surfaces once again, this time as a lascivious Mona Lisa. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.While not wholly satisfying, this latest in a stream of recent gay fiction anthologies offers some valuable, hard-to-find works and ultimately provides informative reading. As with all anthologies, some of the choices for inclusion and exclusion are questionable. Why include an excerpt from Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain when the writer's complete Death in Venice is already given 67 pages? After all, there is only one short piece from Klauss Mann, Thomas's gay brother, and nothing from postwar gay German authors such as Hubert Fichte (The Orphanage, Serpent's Tail, 1991). Indeed, the biggest problem is that well-known and much-published authors who might simply have appeared on a suggested readings list are overrepresented here (including an inexplicable excerpt from Camus's The Plague). If this was meant to be a "great books collection," the editor should have justified his choices, placed them in context, and provided author biographies. Nonetheless, finds such as Reinaldo Arenas's newly translated "Mona" and an excerpt from Edward Limonov's out-of-print It's Me, Eddie make this book a worthy addition to most libraries.<br><i>Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Angel&#39;s Caress</h2><p>Surprised by her lecherous kidnapper&#39;s gentle touch and her own arousal in his embrace, Tennesse farm girl Ellie Crain vows to transform Union officer Cash Gillard&#39;s lust into love</p><p></p><h2>Pat Metheny - Question and Answer (Guitar Recorded Versions)</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions).

Now picture a dapper professor conducting his ornithology class (the university&#x2019;s first) by streetcar to Lake Harriet for a morning of bird-watching. The students were mostly young women&#x2014;in sunhats, sailor tops, and long skirts, with binoculars strung around their necks. The professor was Thomas Sadler Roberts (1858&#x2013;1946), a doctor for three decades, a bird lover virtually from birth, the father of Minnesota ornithology, and the man who, perhaps more than any other, promoted the study of the state&#x2019;s natural history. <i>A Love Affair with Birds</i> is the first full biography of this key figure in Minnesota&#x2019;s past.</p><p>Roberts came to Minnesota as a boy and began keeping detailed accounts of Minneapolis&#x2019;s birds. These journals, which became the basis for his landmark work <i>The Birds of Minnesota</i>, also inform this book, affording a view of the state&#x2019;s rich avian life in its early days&#x2014;and of a young man whose passion for birds and practice of medicine among Minneapolis&#x2019;s elite eventually dovetailed in his launching of the beloved Bell Museum of Natural History.</p><p>Bird enthusiast, doctor, author, curator, educator, conservationist: every chapter in Roberts&#x2019;s life is also a chapter in the state&#x2019;s history, and in his story acclaimed author Sue Leaf&#x2014;an avid bird enthusiast and nature lover herself&#x2014;captures a true Minnesota character and his time.<br></p></p><p><p><br>Sue Leaf is the author of <i>Potato City: Nature, History, and Community in the Age of Sprawl</i> and <i>The Bullhead Queen: A Year on Pioneer Lake</i> (Minnesota, 2009), a finalist for the Minnesota Book Awards. She is the president of the Wild River Audubon Society of east-central Minnesota.<br></p>In 1867, when his wealthy, TB-stricken father heeded doctor&#x2019;s orders to leave dirty Philadelphia, 9-year-old Roberts embraced the rich natural habitat around the frontier town of Minneapolis. At age 16, he formed the Young Naturalists&#x2019; Club, and at 18, he used meticulous field notes to compose a paper challenging a prominent naturalist&#x2019;s opinion on black terns. Serious birding disappeared from Roberts&#x2019; life when he went east for medical school, came home a doctor, and started a family. But birding reclaimed increasing amounts of his time, and he closed his practice in 1915, when the University of Minnesota hired him as a professor of ornithology and as curator of the Zoological Museum. His two-volume The Birds of Minnesota was published in 1932. Roberts&#x2019; letters and notes offer rich descriptions of birdlife, contact with many birding pioneers, and a view inside the shotgun-reliant, �specimen-obsessed world of early birding. Yet the stuffy Roberts, who indirectly witnessed an astounding loss of natural habitat, will never be confused for a conservation visionary, narrowing the appeal of this book to avid birders. --Dane Carr</p><h2>Made for You</h2><p><br>Some mistakes are worth making...<br><br>Lauren Layne's Best Mistake series continues with MADE FOR YOU.<br><br> <b>When the Wrong Guy is Oh-So-Right</b><br><br> Will Thatcher is exactly the type of sexy playboy good girls like Brynn have always avoided.

One of the great promises of the Internet and big data revolutions is the idea that we can improve the processes and routines of our work and personal lives to get more done in less time than we ever have before. There is no doubt that we're performing at higher levels and moving at unprecedented speed, but what if we're headed in the wrong direction?<br><br>Melding the long-term history of technology with the latest headlines and findings of computer science and social science, <i>The Efficiency Paradox</i> questions our ingrained assumptions about efficiency, persuasively showing how relying on the algorithms of digital platforms can in fact lead to wasted efforts, missed opportunities, and, above all, an inability to break out of established patterns. Edward Tenner offers a smarter way of thinking about efficiency, revealing what we and our institutions, when equipped with an astute combination of artificial intelligence and trained intuition, can learn from the random and unexpected.</p><p>EDWARD TENNER is a distinguished scholar of the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation and a visiting scholar in the Rutgers University Department of History. He was a visiting lecturer at the Humanities Council at Princeton and has held visiting research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Pennsylvania.

Journalists and entrepreneurs do not use that word as often as they used to. We&#x2019;ll see synonyms later. But never far from our minds is consciousness of the value of getting the greatest possible output from available inputs, whether increasing production or profits, or reducing time.<br><br>My claim that preoccupation with efficiency in the short term may harm efficiency in the long run risks being considered a heresy by some and a truism by others. I hope to show that it is an obvious proposition when one reflects on it. It is also obvious, as I shall suggest in succeeding chapters and in the Conclusion, that combining efficient algorithms with holistic analog understanding can produce far better results than using either strategy alone. But it is not always simple to defend the obvious. It is helpful to see efficiency as a concept that has developed over the past two hundred years or so, and as a set of practices that are much older. The idea of efficiency, as we shall see, emerged in the age of the steam engine and was best expressed not by the eighteenth-century metaphor of a shop&#x2019;s division of labor (essential as that remained) but by the substitution of continuous production for the fabrication of one unit at a time. The greatest enterprises invested vast capital and employed up to a hundred thousand workers or more to keep it in operation. Both classical economic liberalism and rival doctrines like Marxism reflected this model; it should not be so surprising that even communist governments admired Western mass production.<br><br>The importance of technologies of uninterrupted (&#x201c;continuous process&#x201d;) as opposed to batch production was first underscored by the Swiss architect and critic Siegfried Giedion and the American historian Daniel J. Boorstin in the mid-twentieth century. Rollers, belts, and other devices changed the nature of consumption as well as production. Cable television programs like <i>How It&#x2019;s Made</i> reveal how much of today&#x2019;s industrial processes are already automated, especially when compared to episodes of the <i>Industry on Parade</i> series broadcast on network television in the 1950s. Today&#x2019;s programs will probably look equally quaint in even less time. But further reducing labor costs on assembly lines is not the kind of efficiency that interests us here. It is a new kind of enterprise that has&#x2014;unforeseen by even the boldest futurists&#x2014;taken over what Vladimir Lenin called the commanding heights of the economy, dominating its agendas. &#x201c;Silicon Valley&#x201d; evokes the mixture of admiration, fear, and scorn once inspired by the grimy industrial metropolises of the Northeast and Midwest, but while an approach to Chicago or Detroit or Pittsburgh by automobile or train can still be a visually striking experience, nothing on the peninsula south of San Francisco is tall enough to inspire awe, stupendous as its wealth has become. The server complexes of its companies are scattered as inconspicuously as possible around the globe. Yet the giants of Silicon Valley have ideas about social organization as radical in their own way as Lenin&#x2019;s, and they share with classical communism a passionate faith in efficiency.<br><br>This chapter will investigate the contrast between continuous process efficiency (which fascinated painters as well as photographers and filmmakers in its monumentality and awesome concreteness) and platform efficiency, which is far more profitable but concealed and evanescent and that takes a leap of artistic imagination to dramatize. It will suggest how matchmaking by electronic networks takes advantagenot only of the steady if recently slowed improvement of the efficiency of integrated circuits, but also of the ability of ingenious computational techniques&#x2014;algorithms&#x2014;to multiply the speed of these circuits manyfold.<br><br>This efficiency raises a profound question, the chapter will argue. Why have these platforms apparently had such little effect on the self-perceived satisfaction of the United States and other nations in which they are most advanced? Why are citizens around the world so unhappy with their governments, so ready to look to extreme solutions? One reason may be that the platform revolution has been diverting talent and capital from other technological projects that could be more transformative. I cannot identify them, nor rule out that they are already well advanced and may flower soon. After all, the U.S. boom after the Second World War was in part based on innovations like broadcast television and dry photocopying that actually were under development during the darkest years of the Great Depression, along with Alan Turing&#x2019;s theoretical work that helped make the platform economy possible.<br><br>The question, which I don&#x2019;t pretend to resolve, is why the platform corporation, so profitable for its investors so far (especially the early ones), has been such an underachiever. Enthusiasts will insist that major innovations commonly have troughs of disappointment; the best is yet to come. This is especially the viewpoint of Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who in early 2017 published a manifesto acknowledging mistakes and vowing to build better communities and a better planet with the help of Facebook&#x2019;s users. To many adversaries such promises have long been &#x201c;silicon snake oil&#x201d; and &#x201c;future hype&#x201d;&#x2014;to quote the titles of 1990s and early 2000s books by disillusioned technologists. To critics on the left in particular, the new bosses are not so different from the old bosses, just equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and manipulation in place of the goon squads of yore. Some wary journalists see an existential threat to their own profession in declarations like those of Zuckerberg. I am not sure any organization really has such power. I will suggest at the end of this chapter that the most serious unintended consequence of platform efficiency may be its opportunity cost, its claim on resources that would in the long run do more to promote real efficiency.<br><br>One paradox of the movement for efficiency is that innovations that have promoted efficiency and rationality have arisen in spite of discouraging data, driven by intuition and emotion. That does not mean that gut feelings alone are a more reliable guide than data-based analysis, but only that data, and tools for analyzing it, never can take the place of the imagination in foreseeing future patterns of human behavior. Most such intuitions fail. The exceptions fill inspirational and business books. Venture investment has a high failure rate built into it. Yet out of the inefficient maelstrom emerged some of the world&#x2019;s most efficient technology.<br><br>***<br><br>The history of efficiency should rightly start with nature itself. As biophysicists have discovered, DNA stores energy far more densely than the most advanced technological systems. The control of gene expression allows complex and robust organisms to develop with stunning speed. Tiny variations in the genomes of fruit flies can produce strikingly different behaviors. Evolution has been prodigiously successful in optimizing the flow of information. Leveraging limited resources is our biological heritage.<br><br>The quest for efficiency seems to be built into human biology as well, as revealed by anthropological and archaeological evidence. There have been tens of thousands of years of innovations in tool making that sometimes reached dead ends but occasionally produced masterpieces of functionality. Think of the Australian Aborigines&#x2019; boomerang, or the Central Asian steppe nomads&#x2019; composite bow. Is any cutting tool more efficient than traditionally forged Japanese blades, or sharper than the obsidian knives flaked expertly by pre-Columbian Native Americans?<br><br>Turning to the West, many ancient Roman medical instruments were so well adapted to their purpose that similar ones are used today, and their quality was not surpassed until modern times. Roman troops were famous for their ability to assemble bridges and fortifications with a speed that dazzled their adversaries. There was even a kind of mass production of oil lamps, stamped and marketed with early trademarks.<br><br>Recent archaeology has revealed more dynamism and technologicalinnovation in the ancient world than historians of fifty years ago acknowledged. The slave economy, for example, did not rule out labor-saving machines like water wheels, just as steam engines were used on slavery-era sugar plantations in the early nineteenth century. There was a great deal of efficiency in practice. But the concept of efficiency as we know it had no clear place in ancient life. The ancient Greeks and Romans (and other Mediterranean and Near Eastern societies, including Egypt), had administrative and recordkeeping systems that worked for centuries. But they had no doctrine of systematic improvement of output. The classical historian Peter Thonemann has underlined that Roman society in particular was based on principles of patronage, loyalty, and obligation. There was no theory of wages, interest, or productivity. Prestige was often more important than functionality. Books were written and read as rolls that were stored together in chests. Writing was<i> scriptura continua</i>, no space between words, which space would have increased papyrus and parchment use slightly but made reading and education far easier. The difficulties of reading&#x2014;manipulating the scroll, looking ahead to determine word breaks&#x2014;were part of the performance skills of an educated person. That kind of inefficiency was a feature, not a bug in today&#x2019;s terms.<br><br>Europe of the Middle Ages and the early modern era was a time of growing practical efficiency&#x2014;but also without an underlying theory. The black letter handwriting that seems so quaint and old-fashioned today was actually a relatively rapid and legible style of writing for those accustomed to it. The Romans had the optical knowledge and the glassblowing and metallurgical skills to make eyeglasses, but there was no market for them. Aging literate people had educated slaves to read to them. The Romans made excellent cloth presses (one of which survives at Herculaneum) and could cast bronze letters, but they felt no need for printing.<br><br>By the eighteenth century, Denis Diderot&#x2019;s <i>Encyclop�die</i> and its Scots imitator, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, summarized the knowledge and improvement in dozens of trades. In <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith showed how the separation of the making of pins into distinct operations by specialists could multiply the number of pins each worker could make per day. There was an even finer division of labor in the manufacture of needles in medieval Persia.<br><br>Still, Smith was an exceptional pioneer. The nineteenth-and twentieth-century sense of efficiency was not quite present. A nineteenth-century political economist, whether laissez-faire or socialist, would be deeply interested in measuring just how much more productive a pin workshop would be than a traditional one. Many products were still made according to artisanal tradition and style rather than after systematic study of customer needs. The French technology theorist Jacques Ellul has pointed out that the armorers who made swords for late medieval mercenaries each followed a craft tradition and decorative style without studying the ergonomics of combat. Every soldier had to adapt his fighting style to the instrument.<br><br>No eighteenth-century figure was more celebrated than Benjamin Franklin for his union of practical ingenuity with investigations of scientific theory, despite or because of the limits of his formal education. The designs of Franklin and his contemporaries&#x2014;he never patented his inventions and encouraged further adaptation&#x2014;for fireplace linings significantly improved the efficiency of wasteful conventional fireplaces. But late-eighteenth-century inventors still had no scientific way to quantify savings in heat produced per unit of wood. Only in the mid-nineteenth century did thinkers like the brewer and scientist James Joule develop consistent units to measure heat production: the British thermal unit and the SI (metric) Joule.<br><br>The two inventions that introduced modern efficiency were the work of other geniuses of the early nineteenth century, now known mainly to specialists: the millwright Oliver Evans and the paper manufacturer Henry Fourdrinier. If we look at plates of Diderot&#x2019;s encyclopedia as edited by Charles Gillispie, many of the workshops were not so different from those of the ages of Leonardo da Vinci or Galileo. Masters, assisted by journeymen and apprentices, made each product, though Smith&#x2019;s principle of the division of labor was beginning to spread. Goods were still fashioned individually or in small batches.<br><br>Oliver Evans was the founder of continuous process efficiency. He is less well known than Franklin, Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, or Thomas Edison, but for two centuries he was at least as influential as any of these. As Siegfried Giedion wrote in his classic <i>Mechanization Takes Command</i>, before there was any real American industry, &#x201c;a solitary and prophetic mind set about devising a system wherein mechanical conveyance from one operation to another might eliminate the labor of human hands.&#x201d; Grain was raised to the top of the mill by a chain of buckets and conveyed by gravity through each of the stages of milling with belts, screws, and other continuous conveyances. Individually these were not entirely new; some had existed since antiquity. The idea of an integrated system that processed raw materialsand semifinished products was still a breathtaking step in efficiency. Evans&#x2019;s system seemed shaky and he lacked Franklin&#x2019;s persuasive powers, but in &#x201c;the power of his vision,&#x201d; Giedion rightly concluded, &#x201c;Oliver Evans&#x2019; invention opens a new chapter in the history of mankind.&#x201d;<br><br>The second of the landmarks of classic modern efficiency was the Fourdrinier paper mill. Ever since its introduction in China, and to this day in the production of Japanese artisanal papers like washi, paper was made from fibers in individual sheets. Papermakers were highly skilled workers who formed powerful guilds; books and newspapers were still costly. A French printer named Nicolas-Louis Robert was the first to understand the potential of continuous paper production. As the historian Mark Kurlansky has pointed out, Robert&#x2019;s invention of a wire framework used the principle of today&#x2019;s conveyor belts, but actually preceded their invention. (The first use wasby the Royal Navy for the manufacture of ship&#x2019;s biscuits in 1804.) In his machine, a moving screen received the wet fibers and agitated the pulp laterally to distribute it evenly, as sheet paper artisans did. After the water was removed, the semifinished paper was rolled on to a series of drums, the final ones heated, for drying. The paper manufacturers Henry and David Fourdrinier made technical improvements in the Robert process, but not enough to make it practical, and they were forced to declare bankruptcy. It was the engineer Bryan Donkin who finally made usable continuous papermaking machines on the basis of Robert&#x2019;s idea. This complex parentage reveals an important feature of continuous process efficiency: even more than other innovations, it is the drawn-out result of failure, collaboration, and competition.</p><h2>8 Attributes of Great Achievers, Vol. 2</h2><p>This book is filled with inspiring stories from the lives of great achievers past and present.

Tired of the different standards applied to the men who flout society&#x2019;s rules, three young ladies seek a little primitive justice and hatch a plan to bring a few of London&#x2019;s most notorious rakes up to snuff before refusing them. But they soon learn exactly what it is that makes rakes so dangerous. Tasked with bringing down the most notorious rake of all, the always capable and efficient Lady Georgina &#x201c;Gina&#x201d; Beauclerk is determined to show the wicked Earl of Coventry just what she has to offer... by promptly turning his dissolute world on its ear. Instead she finds her own world spinning out of control. Because even after she has organized his household, rid his home of alcohol, and paid off his mistress, she can&#x2019;t help but see that there is more to the handsome earl than first she realized. Forced into respectable society to escort his debuting sister, Coventry intends to find her a husband posthaste so he can return to the freedom and debauchery of his clubs. After the death of his unfaithful wife, the disillusioned Coventry has no intention of ever marrying again&#x2014;especially not to an interfering busybody who won&#x2019;t take &#x201c;no&#x201d; for an answer.

Scottish Historical romances, including her current Highland Guard series (THE CHIEF, THE HAWK, THE RANGER, THE VIPER, THE SAINT, THE RECRUIT, THE HUNTER, THE KNIGHT (novella), THE RAIDER and THE ARROW), and two Regency Romances (THE UNTHINKABLE and TAMING THE RAKE).

During his travels and subsequent research, including walking hundreds of miles in complete Roman military gear, he has learned much about the Romans and the way they lived. Nine of his eleven novels have been <i>Sunday Times</i> top ten bestsellers, and his books are published in twelve languages; a million copies have sold worldwide. In 2016, his research was recognised by Bristol University with an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.

Some seeking acceptance or honour or revenge. A few grasping for power and glory, but most ultimately just trying to stay alive. I for one was fascinated by the differing tactics, fighting styles and weapons, as represented by the Roman cohort and the Greek phalanx. Or, as exhibited close up and personal in the flashing melee of the gladius and pike. These contrasts seemed to speak, with horrific eloquence, of the slaughter of the classical world of Homer and Alexander.

While the buildings still stood, students now attended Western Albemarle High School, a large complex consolidating former small community schools. Jessica Hexham, Alicia Palmer, Charlene Vavilov, and Arden Higham had not. Jessica had attended Miss Porter&#x2019;s; Alicia, Orange High School; Arden, Buck�ingham High; and Charlene, older than the others, had attended St. Catherine&#x2019;s in Richmond.<br><br>With the exception of Jessica, all were central Virginia natives.

God bless Miss Donleavey. She taught us well.&#x201d;<br><br>Jessica also recalled her Latin teacher at the expensive private school, perhaps less fondly. &#x201c;I would never bless Miss Greely.&#x201d;<br><br>The others laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Charlene, bet you took Latin at St. Catherine&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Alicia wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t go to college without two years of it,&#x201d; said Charlene. &#x201c;I took four. It&#x2019;s helped me more than I could know when I hated memorizing those conjugations.&#x201d; She laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Funny, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; the uncommonly beautiful Alicia said. &#x201c;What we use? What we remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What I remember, apart from amo, amas, amat, was Miss Donleavey&#x2019;s mysterious disappearance. Never found her.&#x201d; Harry picked up the cards to shuffle.<br><br>Susan reached across the card table, placing her hand on Harry&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Harry blinked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll shuffle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you calling me a cheat?&#x201d; Harry&#x2019;s voice rose.<br><br>&#x201c;No, but you won the last hand, so it&#x2019;s my turn to shuffle. Plus, what if you have a hot hand?&#x201d; Susan used the gambling term.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better tell that to my husband.&#x201d;<br><br>This evoked more laughter.<br><br>The lights flickered, once, twice, then no light.<br><br>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; Susan cursed the dark. &#x201c;Stay put, ladies. I&#x2019;ll get the candles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need my little flashlight.&#x201d; Harry reached into her pocket, pulling out a two-�and-�a-�half-�inch LED flashlight made in China.<br><br>Susan pressed the button. &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else do you have in your pocket?&#x201d; Jessica asked.<br><br>&#x201c;One pocketknife,&#x201d; BoomBoom answered for Harry. &#x201c;She always has a pocketknife and a little money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The emphasis is on little,&#x201d; said Harry, emptying her pockets onto the card table as Susan returned with candles.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me help you.&#x201d; Thanks to the tiny LED flashlight, Alicia could see. She reached for some candles.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hurricane glass lamp. Well, here, let&#x2019;s do it together. Girls, we&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>True to her word, Susan and Alicia returned to the living room with small brass candleholders, which they placed about and lit. The large hurricane candleholder glowed on the card table. All held six-� to eight-�inch candles.<br><br>Susan noticed the small pile of debris.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry, what&#x2019;s your stuff doing on the card table?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jessica wanted to know what was in my pocket.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the dark?&#x201d; Susan questioned.<br><br>&#x201c;We knew there&#x2019;d be light,&#x201d; Harry shot back.<br><br>Jessica dutifully investigated the contents: one Case pocketknife, a folded cotton handkerchief, twenty-�two dollars in small bills, one dog cookie.<br><br>Harry pointed out the cookie. &#x201c;Never know when I might get hungry.&#x201d;<br><br>The ladies laughed again as Alicia walked to the large triple-�sash windows. &#x201c;Girls, we&#x2019;re in for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No kidding?&#x201d; Harry hurried over, as did the others.<br><br>&#x201c;The storm&#x2019;s early.&#x201d; BoomBoom, like all country people, paid intense attention to the weather.<br><br>&#x201c;We have a little time before we need to worry about the roads,&#x201d; Harry confidently predicted. &#x201c;Everyone has four-�wheel drive, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If not, I&#x2019;m happy to sell you one.&#x201d; Charlene smiled. She and her husband, Pete, owned the Ford dealership.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re good,&#x201d; the others replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s not play cards by candlelight. Ladies, I whipped up vegetable hors d&#x2019;oeuvres, and they&#x2019;re really tasty, if I do say so myself. I can&#x2019;t eat them all. You have to help me. Harry, use your flashlight again and let&#x2019;s bring the food out from the kitchen. BoomBoom, you know where the bar is. Give the girls what they want.&#x201d;<br><br>BoomBoom picked up a candle as she glided to the well-�stocked bar. Susan&#x2019;s husband, Ned, was a delegate to the state legislature in Richmond, and the couple entertained frequently. In this part of the world, good liquor was considered an essential by any host and hostess. Southerners did drink wine, but many still preferred a high-�octane bourbon or scotch, and then there were the legions of vodka drinkers who believed it didn&#x2019;t linger on their breath.<br><br>Once settled in the living room, comfortable in decidedly not-�modern d�cor, Jessica, curious, asked, &#x201c;So what did happen to your Latin teacher?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody knows.&#x201d; BoomBoom shrugged. &#x201c;She disappeared after a Friday-�night football game. Her car was in the parking lot. Monday, she didn&#x2019;t come to school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We played the Louisa Dragons that night,&#x201d; Harry recalled. &#x201c;Good game. Miss Donleavey never missed a football game.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She dated the coach, Mr. Toth,&#x201d; Susan filled in. &#x201c;Handsome, handsome, handsome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coach Toth? That Toth?&#x201d; Jessica asked. &#x201c;Silver Linings?&#x201d; She mentioned a youth organization the coach supported, as did all the husbands of the women in the room. Apart from helping young men, business leaders and former athletes ran Silver Linings. To belong was beneficial to one&#x2019;s career.<br><br>&#x201c;Jessica, this must be irritating, being in the middle of a bunch of old friends.&#x201d; Harry handed her a napkin.<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fascinating. A vanished Latin teacher.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know the stereotype of the old-�maid Latin teacher? Well, not Miss Donleavey. She was voluptuous, raven-�haired, so pretty,&#x201d; BoomBoom noted, herself voluptuous.<br><br>&#x201c;Suspects?&#x201d; Jessica&#x2019;s eyebrows raised.<br><br>Miranda answered. &#x201c;At first, people thought it might have been a rival of the coach&#x2019;s. Men were crazy for her.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan added, &#x201c;Lots of men were questioned. Everyone had an alibi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone else?&#x201d; Jessica persisted.<br><br>&#x201c;Esther Mercier. Hated Miss Donleavey, just hated her.&#x201d; Harry bit into a carrot incised with a tiny trench filled with rich cream cheese.<br><br>&#x201c;In love with Coach Toth.&#x201d; BoomBoom filled in facts. &#x201c;An attractive enough woman, but not in Miss Donleavey&#x2019;s league.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was her first name?&#x201d; Jessica asked. &#x201c;Miss Donleavey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh, Margaret. It&#x2019;s funny, but I still have a hard time calling my teachers by their first names. I mean, Coach Toth is always Coach Toth.&#x201d; Susan smiled. &#x201c;And eventually he did marry Miss Mercier, one of the math teachers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think someone would have known something. Crozet is still a small place,&#x201d; Charlene wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;If they did, no one noticed. Crozet, like any place anywhere in the world, is full of secrets that people take to their graves,&#x201d; Harry remarked. &#x201c;Miss Donleavey&#x2019;s kin, all older, are gone. It&#x2019;s one of those persistent small-�town mysteries.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, people don&#x2019;t just disappear off the face of the earth.&#x201d; Alicia twirled a fresh bit of broccoli.<br><br>&#x201c;The Black Dahlia,&#x201d; BoomBoom countered.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, to a degree,&#x201d; said Alicia. &#x201c; &#x2019;Course, I wasn&#x2019;t in Hollywood then. And she didn&#x2019;t disappear, Sweetie. They never found the killer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; BoomBoom got up and walked over to the window, nose almost on the windowpane. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really coming down now. We&#x2019;d all better head home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me help you clean up,&#x201d; Harry offered.<br><br>&#x201c;A tray of vegetables and a couple of glasses? Anyway, no power, no water. Go on. If your cellphones don&#x2019;t work you can still text if you have a Droid.&#x201d;<br><br>Arden said, &#x201c;I hope the Silver Linings fund-�raiser isn&#x2019;t canceled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll cross our fingers.&#x201d; Charlene crossed hers.<br><br>After a long, careful drive, Harry slowly finally drove down her long farm driveway, windshield wipers flipping as fast as they could. She pulled in front of the old white frame farmhouse, cut the motor, the lights with it.<br><br>Golden candlelight cascaded over the snow. The frosted windows glowed pale gold, the wavy imperfections of the hand�blown glass all the more obvious with the candles behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s home.&#x201d; Inside the house, Tucker the corgi barked joyfully.<br><br>Pewter flopped on the kitchen table, lifted her head. &#x201c;About time.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, walked alongside Fair, Harry&#x2019;s husband, as he opened the kitchen door to the porch. He carried a huge flashlight, which he focused on the path to the back porch, screened-�in in summer, glassed-�in in winter.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re home.&#x201d; He stepped into the snow.<br><br>&#x201c;Fair, get back inside. I can see.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t, of course, kissing her as she hurried onto the porch, Tucker and Mrs. Murphy at her feet.</p><h2>Fooled Again: How the Right Stole the 2004 Election and Why They&#39;ll Steal the Next One Too (Unless We Stop Them)</h2><p>For Republicans, the 2004 presidential election was little short of miraculous: Behind in the Electoral College tally in the days leading up to the election, behind even on the very afternoon of the vote, the Bush ticket staged a stunning comeback. The exit polls, usually so reliable, turned out to be wrong by an unprecedented 5 percent in the swing states. Conservatives argued-and the media agreed-that &#34;moral values&#34; had made the difference. In his new book renowned critic and political commentator Mark Crispin Miller argues that it wasn&#39;t moral values that swung the election-it was theft. While the greatest body of evidence comes from the key state of Ohio-where the Democratic staff of the House Judiciary Committee found an extraordinary onslaught of Republican-engineered vote suppression, election-day irregularities, old-fashioned intimidation tactics, and illegal counting procedures-similar practices (and occasionally worse ones) were applied in Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and even New York. A huge array of anomalies, improper practices, and blatant violations of the law all, by a truly remarkable coincidence, happened to swing in the Bush ticket&#39;s favor.This pattern-not one overwhelming fraud but thousands of little ones-is, in Miller&#39;s view, the new Republican electoral strategy. This incendiary new book presents massive documentation that the election was stolen and describes the mind-set, among both the major parties and the media, that could permit it to happen again.</p><p><b>Mark Crispin Miller</b> is a professor of media studies at New York University and a well-known public intellectual.

Miller relies on original reporting, secondary sources and unadulterated outrage to make his case, marshaling evidence (much of it circumstantial) of Democratic voter disenfranchisement, mysterious computer snafus and discrepancies between exit poll results and official vote counts. He is especially critical of the press for what he describes as silence in the face of Bush's and Cheney's denials of fraud. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is another target of Miller's ire, for ignoring warnings of coordinated Republican plans to cheat and for doing nothing to contest the vote counts, especially in swing states Ohio and Florida. "Election-stealing" in Florida in particular presages a dark future for the entire nation: "a system built specifically to disenfranchise an aroused and even militant majority, and to do so without leaving any traces." Though Miller's sometimes unclear sourcing puts the burden on readers to separate fact from hearsay, he gathers enough well-documented evidence that anyone who cares about fair play should find this book revelatory. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet, ambivalently, his penis has always been the source of man's deepest neuroses too. Do women find it, in the erect state, inherently ridiculous? Why can't a man be certain his penis will stand and deliver when he commands? If and when it steadfastly refuses, what can he do to remedy the situation? <br>&nbsp;<br>And then, of course, there's the matter of size... <br>&nbsp;<br>To possess a penis, Sophocles said, is to be 'chained to a madman'. <i>God's Doodle </i>examines the schizophrenic relationship between man and this madman -- and the joint relationship this odd couple has with the female sex. &nbsp;<i>God's Doodle </i>is the tale of the penis and the ups and downs of history -- the macabre and the bloodcurdling, the funny and the sad, distilled from myth, world cultures, religion, literature, science, medicine and contemporary life -- all told with mordant wit.</p><p>TOM HICKMAN has worked as a journalist on national magazines, newspapers and for the BBC.

And he does a lot. Although categorized as humor (because, hey, penises are intrinsically funny), the book is actually a remarkably entertaining and informative look at the male organ down through the ages: the evolution not of the penis itself (which, let&#x2019;s face it, hasn&#x2019;t really changed) but of our perceptions of and attitudes toward it. We get some history, some religion, some sociology, some linguistics (dick comes out of rhyming slang, &#x201c;dickory dock&#x201d; for cock, and nut derives from nutmeg), and some myth-busting (the size of a man&#x2019;s organ doesn&#x2019;t correlate to the size of his hands or feet or nose). This is an undeniably funny book&#x2014;the author quotes an excerpt of a D. H. Lawrence novel, noting the penis&#x2019; &#x201c;tumescent thicket of exclamation marks&#x201d;&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s also packed with plenty of things you probably never even knew (like, for example, the centuries-long religious kerfuffle surrounding the holy foreskin: the part of the baby Jesus that was removed at circumcision). Fascinating stuff. --David Pitt</p><h2>Groovin&#39; High: The Life of Dizzy Gillespie</h2><p>Dizzy Gillespie was one of the most important and best-loved musicians in jazz history. With his horn-rimmed glasses, goatee, jive talk, and upraised trumpet bell, he was the hipster who most personified bebop. The musical heir to Louis Armstrong, he created the modern jazz trumpet-playing style and dazzled aficionados and popular audiences alike for over 50 years.<br> <br> In this first full biography, Alyn Shipton covers all aspects of Dizzy's remarkable life and career, taking us through his days as a flashy trumpet player in the swing bands of the 1930s, his innovative bebop work in the 1940s, the worldwide fame and adoration he earned through his big band tours in the 1950s, and the many recordings and performances which defined a career that extended into the early 1990s. Along the way, Shipton convincingly argues that Gillespie--rather than Charlie Parker as is widely believed--had the greatest role in creating bebop, playing in key jazz groups, teaching the music to others, and helping to develop the first original bebop repertory. Shipton also explores the dark side of Dizzy's mostly sunny personal life, his womanizing, the illegitimate daughter he fathered and supported--now a respected jazz singer in her own right--and his sometimes needless cruelty to others.<br> <br> For anyone interested in jazz and one of its most innovative and appealing figures, <em>Groovin' High</em> is essential reading.</p><p>British author and BBC radio host Alyn Shipton's biography on the world-renowned puffy-cheeked trumpeter/composer/bandleader John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie is the most comprehensive to date. It's an excellent follow-up to Gillespie's 1980 memoir, <i>To Be or Not to Bop</i>, and it contains new interviews with many of his associates, including pianist Dave Brubeck, author John Chilton, and bassist Milt Hinton. In addition to detailing Gillespie's South Carolina origins and his mid-1940s co-creations of bebop and Latin jazz (with drummer Kenny Clarke, saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianist Thelonious Monk, and composer Mario Bauza), the author penetrates his fun-loving, goatee-sporting, beret-wearing, and generally zany fa�ade. "This was bizarre behavior indeed," writes Shipton, "but part of a pattern that led more than one commentator to the conclusion that Dizzy was 'crazy like a fox,' a shrewd operator who meticulously filed away in his mind any shred of fact or information that might come in handy some day." Shipton reveals him to be a man who sometimes angered and alienated his fellow musicians, as evidenced by trumpeter's infamous spitball affair with Cab Calloway; his fathering of a daughter by a white woman out of wedlock in 1958, and his spiritual quest for world brotherhood as a member of the Islam-based Baha'i faith. Shipton's portrait of Gillespie in his final years in the late '80s and '90s as the leader of his multiracial United Nation Orchestra is that of an elder statesman, cultural ambassador, and musical innovator. "With his death," Shipton writes, "the world lost a man who had revolutionized jazz, gave it a set of principles on which it could develop musically, and shown by example how to create within those principles at the highest level." <i>--Eugene Holley, Jr.</i><br><strong>Alyn Shipton</strong> presents jazz programs for the BBC and is a jazz critic for <em>The Times</em> in London.

When they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate, for the first and only time, and from that fiery union new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds. This was known as the Big Bang hypothesis.<br><br>*<br><br>The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home of a large number of gangs, thieves&#x2019; guilds, syndicates and similar organizations.

The fact that later on, when her house collapsed in flames, she herself died in a freak landslide in the Morpork Mountains, proves that Death, too, has a sense of humour.<br><br>*<br><br>The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork smiled, but with his mouth only.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure you won&#x2019;t dream of trying to escape from your obligations by fleeing the city . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I assure you the thought never even crossed my mind, lord.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Indeed?

His appearances draw&nbsp;sell-out crowds across the country and are among the most reproduced on the Web. &#x201c;And one reason,&#x201d; writes noted journalist Bill McKibben, &#x201c;is that Moyers pulls no punches. His understanding of America&#x2019;s history is at least as deep as his understanding of Christian tradition, which is an integral part of his background . . . With his feet firmly planted in the deepest American traditions, Bill Moyers is helping to keep alive an oratorical tradition that is fading after two centuries.

FOR AMERICA'S SAKE</b><br><i><br>A New Story for America</i><br>December 12, 2006<br><i>My father dropped out of the fourth grade and never returned to school because his family needed him to pick cotton to help make ends meet. The Great Depression knocked him down and almost out. When I was born he was making $2 a day working on the highway to Oklahoma City. He never took home more than $100 a week in his working life, and he made that only when he joined the union in the last job he held. He voted for Franklin Roosevelt in four straight elections and would have gone on voting for him until kingdom come if he'd had the chance. I once asked him why, and he said, "Because he was my friend." My father of course never met FDR; no politician ever paid him much note. Many years later when I wound up working in the White House my parents came for a visit and my father asked to see the Roosevelt Room. I don't quite know how to explain it, except that my father knew who was on his side. When FDR died my father wept; he had lost his friend. This man with a fourth-grade education understood what the patrician in the White House meant when he talked about "economic royalism" and how private power no less than public power can bring America to ruin in the absence of democratic controls. When the president said "the malefactors of great wealth" had concentrated into their own hands "an almost complete control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's labor, and other people's lives," my father said amen; he believed the president knew what life was like for people like him. When the president said life was no longer free, liberty no longer real, men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness against "economic tyranny such as this," my father nodded. He got it when Roosevelt said that a government by money was as much to be feared as a government by mob, and that the political equality we once had was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. Against organized wealth, FDR said that "the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government." My father knew the president meant him.<br><br>Today my father would be written out of America's story. He would belong to what the sociologist Katherine Newman calls the "missing class"*--the fifty-seven million Americans who occupy an obscure place between the rungs of our social ladder, earning wages above the minimum but below a secure standard of living. They work hard for their $20,000 to $40,000 a year, and they are vital to the functioning of the country, as transit workers, day-care providers, hospital attendants, teachers' aides, clerical assistants. They live one divorce, one pink slip, one illness away from a free fall. Largely forgotten by the press, politicians, and policy makers who fashion government safety nets, they have no nest egg, no income but the next paycheck, no way of paying for their children to go to college. Over the years I have chronicled the lives of some of these people in my documentaries. Now, a few days after the election of 2006, I was asked to speak at a conference sponsored by </i>The Nation,<i> the Brennan Center for Justice, the New Democracy Project, and Demos to discuss the prospects of democracy. Those prospects are dim, I realized, unless we write a story of America that includes those people who are living on the edge, with no friend in the White House.</i><br>***<br><br>You could not have chosen a better time to gather. Voters have provided a respite from a right-wing radicalism predicated on the philosophy that extremism in the pursuit of virtue is no vice. It seems only yesterday that the Trojan horse of conservatism was hauled into Washington to disgorge Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Ralph Reed, Grover Norquist, and their band of ravenous predators masquerading as a political party of small government, fiscal restraint, and moral piety and promising "to restore accountability to Congress...(and) make us all proud again of the way free people govern themselves."<br><br>Well, the long night of the cabal is over, and Democrats are ebullient as they prepare to take charge of the multitrillion-dollar influence racket that we used to call the U.S. Congress. Let them rejoice while they can, as long as they remember that they have arrived at this moment mainly because George W. Bush started a war most people have come to believe should never have been fought in the first place. Let them remember that although they are reveling in the ruins of a Republican reign brought down by stupendous scandals, their own closet is stocked with skeletons from an era when they were routed from office following ABSCAM bribes and savings and loan swindles that plucked the pockets and purses of hardworking Americans. As they rejoice Democrats would be wise to be mindful of Shakespeare's counsel: "Merit doth much, but fortune more." For they were delivered from the wilderness not by their own goodness but by the hubris of the party in power--a recurring phenomenon of American democracy.<br><br>Whatever one might say about the 2006 election, the real story is one that our political and media elites are loath to acknowledge or address. I am not speaking of the lengthy list of priorities that progressives and liberals are eager to put on the table now that Democrats hold the cards in Congress. The other day a message popped up on my computer from a progressive advocate who is committed to movement building from the ground up and has results to show for his labors. His request was simple: "With changes in Congress and at our state capitol, we want your input on what top issues our lawmakers should tackle. Click here to submit your top priority."<br><br>I clicked. Up came a list of thirty-four issues&#x2014;an impressive list that began with "African American" and ran alphabetically through "energy" and "guns," to "higher education" "transportation," "women's issues," and "worker's rights." It wasn't a list to be dismissed by any means, for it came from an unrequited thirst for action after a long season of fierce opposition to every aspiration on the agenda. I understand the mind-set. Here's a fellow who values allies and appreciates what it takes to build coalitions; who knows that although our interests as citizens vary, each one is an artery to the heart that pumps life through the body politic, and each is important to the health of democracy. This is an activist who knows political success is the sum of many parts.<br><br>But America needs something more right now than a "must-do" list from liberals and progressives. America needs a different story.<br><br>The very morning I read the message from the progressive activist, <i>The New York Times</i> reported on Carol Ann Reyes. She is sixty-three, lives in Los Angeles, suffers from dementia, and is homeless. Somehow she made her way to a hospital with serious, untreated needs. No details were provided as to what happened to her there, except that the hospital called a cab and sent her back to skid row. True, they phoned ahead to workers at a rescue shelter to let them know she was coming. But some hours later a surveillance camera picked her up "wandering around the streets in a hospital gown and slippers." Dumped in America.<br><br>Here is the real political story, the one most politicians won't even acknowledge: the reality of the anonymous, disquieting daily struggle of ordinary people, including not only the most marginalized and vulnerable Americans but also young workers, elders and parents, families and communities, searching for dignity and fairness against long odds in an amoral market world.<br><br>Everywhere you turn you'll find people who believe they have been written out of the story. Everywhere you turn there's a sense of insecurity grounded in a gnawing fear that freedom in America has come to mean the freedom of the rich to get richer even as millions of Americans are thrown overboard. So let me say what I think up front: the leaders and thinkers and activists who honestly tell that story and speak passionately of the moral and religious values it puts in play will be the first political generation since the New Deal to win power back for the people.<br><br>There's no mistaking America is ready for change. One of our leading analysts of public opinion, Daniel Yankelovich, reports that a majority want social cohesion and common ground based on pragmatism and compromise, patriotism and diversity. But because of the great disparities in wealth the "shining city on the hill" has become a gated community whose privileged occupants, surrounded by moats of money and protected by a political system seduced with cash into subservience, are removed from the common life of the country.<br><br>The wreckage of this revolt of elites is all around us. Corporations are shredding the social compact, pensions are disappearing, medium incomes are flattening, and health-care costs are soaring. In many ways, the average household is generally worse off today than it was thirty years ago, and the public sector that improved life for millions of Americans across three generations is in tatters. For a time, stagnating wages were somewhat offset by more work and more personal debt. Both political parties craftily refashioned those major renovations of the average household as the new standard, shielding employers from responsibility for anything Wall Street would not reward. Now, however, the more acute major risks workers have been forced to bear as employers reduce their health and retirement costs have reveal that gains made by people who live paycheck to paycheck are being reversed. Polls show a majority of American workers now believe their children will be worse off than they were. In one recent survey, only 14 percent of workers said that they have obtained the American dream.<br><br>It is hard to believe that less than four decades ago a key architect of the antipoverty program, R...</p><h2>NEWGATE OF CONNECTICUT, Its Origin and Early History</h2><p>128pp. Dustjacket, several dozen photos and illus, extensive prisoner lists, 988 entry Every Name Index. 1996 (1876, 1901) #1765 $12.95 <p>Newgate was the original colonial prison, established in 1770 in a copper mine in Simsbury, Connecticut. Long a major tourist attraction, the prison and mine can easily be visited today. In 1827 the prison was closed, but during the 1770-1827 period several thousand prisoners were held here, including many during the American Revolution. </p><p>The first half of this book is a reprint of the history of the prison, first published in 1876. The remainder consists of verbatim transcripts of the surviving prisoner lists, never before published, currently held by the Connecticut Historical Commission, which maintains the prison today. These lists include the prisoners' names, ages, birth place, crime and date of conviction, sentence, costs of trial, and often other data such as height, complexion, etc., etc. </p><p>This is a unique book, offering us an unusual look into the seamier side of colonial and early American life. We hesitate to suggest that genealogists will find ancestors here; let's leave it that this is a reference source all of us will want to check for possible collateral cousins. Highly recommended; one of my personal favorites!</p></p><p></p><h2>The Champion</h2><p>Stefan and Hervi are half-brothers who meet in France, Stefan becomes Hervi&#39;s squire and joins his band of immoral travellers. Stefan befriends a girl, Monday, who becomes pregnant by him but goes to England as the mistress of King John. The couple are later reunited and now older, fall in love.</p><p>&#34;Reading an Elizabeth Chadwick novel is the next best thing to time travel.&#34; --Sharon Kay PenmanIn the spring of 1193, seventeen-year-old Alexander de Montroi flees the monastery where he'd been training as a novice, and joins his soldier brother, Hervi, in Normandy. Alexander has ambitions to become a great knight among the men who earn their living by hiring their swords and taking part in jousting contests. For those who show exceptional talent, there are fortunes and hearts to be won, and Alexander soon proves himself adept at both. <p>Monday de Cerizay is the only daughter of Arnaud, a friend of Hervi, and his wife, Clemence. Her parents are poor, but they work hard, and live a happy life. Monday, who is three years younger than Alexander, is smitten with the dashing younger soldier, but he is too busy pursuing his own career and glory to pay her much attention. </p><p>Suddenly, Arnaud is killed, and Hervi becomes Monday's guardian, drawing her even further into Alexander's life. One night, after too much wine and too little self-control, Alexander and Monday lie together, but, proud and headstrong, Monday is determined not to become just another of Alexander's conquests. Pregnant, confused, and betrayed, she flees, determined to make a life for herself beyond the tawdry squalor of the tourney circuits. Alexander is devastated by Monday's sudden flight. </p><p>When he and Monday meet once more it is as strangers. As they come to know one another again, they find themselves facing the wrath of a king, the ambitions of Monday's bitter grandfather, and the vengeful fury of an old foe from Alexander's younger jousting days. </p><p>From the mud-soaked field of France to the refinement of the royal court, from moments of breathtaking passion to the cold-hearted machinations of medieval politics, <i>The Champion</i> is an epic, unforgettable tale of love, injustice, and revenge, as page-turningly dramatic as it is historically valid.</p></p><h2>LORDS OF GOLDEN HORN (RP</h2><p>Spine creased, page edges tanned.

Their writings, including the seminal books <i>Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture</i> (1966; Venturi) and <i>Learning from Las Vegas</i> (1972; Venturi, Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour), have profoundly influenced architectural thought. The built work of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates of Philadelphia has had an equally great impact. Through a commitment to a creative understanding of history and the everyday environment and to the use of visual references in the design of buildings, this firm has changed the face of modern architecture. Guild House (1963), the Vanna Venturi House (1963), and Franklin Court (1976), all in Philadelphia, are key examples of a new outlook on the art of building.<br><br> This landmark monograph -- assembled in collaboration with the architects -- illustrates the firm's work between 1986 and 1998. In his main text, Stanislaus von Moos analyzes the architects' understanding of tradition in relation to the social and urban complexities of our post-industrial, multicultural era. Featured are acclaimed buildings such as the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London; the Seattle Museum of Art; buildings for such universities and colleges as Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, UCLA, and Dartmouth; and new works, including the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, the hotel and recreation center in Nikko Kirifuri, Japan, and the administration building for the D�partement de la Haute-Garonne in Toulouse, France.</p><p>Stanislaus von Moos, a Swiss art and architectural historian, is professor of modern art at the University of Zurich. His books include <i>Le Corbusier: Elements of a Synthesis</i> and <i>Album La Roche</i>.Instrumental in combining postmodern theory with architectural practice, Robert Venturi also revived architectural discourse with his influential monograph Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966). With Denise Scott Brown he has created a substantial body of work that illustrates their precepts: the incorporation of symbols and signs, both literal and abstract; the exaggeration of particular expressive elements; and references, often ironic, to the history of architecture. Moos, who has written on the works dating from 1960 through 1985 in Venturi, Rauch &amp; Scott Brown, offers an insightful and substantive appraisal of the work in these five thematic essays. The larger part of the monograph, however, is a catalog of careful and highly informative descriptions of each building or project by the architects themselves, with accompanying high-quality photographs, plans, and sections. In a somewhat awkward conclusion, a seemingly random set of interview questions elicits informative responses from the architects.

A. MONTGOMERY attended Hopkins Grammar School, Williston-Northampton School and Williams College where he graduated in 1958. He pursued graduate studies in Religion and Economics at Yale and NYU. Montgomery was an adventurer all his life, climbing mountains in the Himalaya, skiing throughout Europe and scuba-diving wherever he could. His interested included education, macro-economics, geo-politics, mythology, history, mystery novels and music. He wrote his first interactive book, Journey Under the Sea, in 1976 and published it under the series name The Adventures of You. A few years later Bantam Books bought this book and gave Montgomery a contract for five more, to inaugurate their new children s publishing division. Bantam renamed the series Choose Your Own Adventure and a publishing phenomenon was born. The series has sold more than 260 million copies in over 40 languages. He was married to the writer Shannon Gilligan.

Leaving home and school in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia aged 16, she crossed to Scotland to spend a year at school near Glasgow. It was there that her love for Scotland was born. After studying music in New York and Paris she returned to live for six years with two sisters in South Uist. Life on the island had changed little from previous centuries, and material comforts were few. But the island was rich in music and tradition, and Margaret Fay Shaw&#39;s collections of Gaelic lore and song are amongst the most important made this century, whilst her photography evocatively captures the aura of a vanished world.</p><p><b>Margaret Fay Shaw</b> died on Canna in 2004 at the age of 101. She was one of the most notable collectors of authentic Scottish Gaelic song and traditions in the 20th century. Shaw was also an outstanding photographer, and both her still pictures and cinematography contributed to an invaluable archive of island life in the 1930s. She met the folklorist John Lorne Campbell on South Uist in 1934; they married a year later and together helped to rescue vast quantities of oral tradition from oblivion. Her autobiography has been almost continuously in print since its first publication in 1994.&#39;This autobiography is a miniature masterpiece.

As D.M. Thomas points out in his introduction, practically none of her poetry was published between 1923 and 1940. Her poetic range was wide, from the transparent anonymity of &#x201c;Requiem&#x201d; to the symphonic complexity of &#x201c;Poem without a Hero.&#x201d; She was revered and loved not only by the best of her fellow poets but by the ordinary people of Russia: five thousand mourners, mostly the young, crowded to her requiem mass in a Leningrad church.<br><br><i>You Will Hear Thunder</i> brings together for the first time all D.M.

By the author of Death By Pantyhouse.</p><p>&#34;The $3,000 fee charged by freelance writer Jaine Austen (Shoes to Die For, 2005, etc.) doesn&#39;t begin to compensate for the psychic travail of working for a bitchy high-school classmate. Patti Marshall sat at the popular table in the Hermosa High cafeteria. Jaine, on the other hand, is best remembered for her swan dive into the principal&#39;s lap at the prom. But at the urging of her MasterCard bill, Jaine agrees to write the wedding vows for Patti&#39;s lollapalooza of a wedding to Dickie Potter, a former nerd who turned out kinda sexy. A dozen rewrites later, Patti returns to her original theme: a reworking of Shakespeare&#39;s balcony scene. Only someone has tampered with this balcony, and Patti tumbles lawnward, where she&#39;s impaled on a specially imported statue of Cupid. Suspicion naturally falls on Normalynne Potter, the wife Dickie kicked to the curb for Patti. But there are plenty of other possibilities: Cheryl Hogan, the bridesmaid Patti nixed as too fat; Dickie&#39;s protective mom Eleanor; even Veronica Hubbard, the caterer who endured Patti&#39;s complaints that the fish was too &#34;fishy&#34; and the lamb chops were too &#34;lamby.&#34; And Jaine aims to confront them all, even as she&#39;s ducking the unwanted advances of Walter Barnhardt, a former Hermosa High nerd who turned out kinda nerdy.

The novel and stories have influenced numerous writers over the years, and are now gathered for the first time (with a new, never-before-published tale) in this unique tribute volume celebrating one of the most influential and award-winning writers of the last two decades.

Monty Jones, the very model of the modern sensitive male, is badly shaken after the gang-rape of his wife, Becky. Having left their home in Galveston, Tex., the couple hope to restore their damaged relationship at a friend's country cabin, but unbeknownst to them, Becky's assailants are coming back to finish what they started. This upsetting look at the human capacity for evil breaks with crime novel conventions when a supernatural element enters the story in the form of the grotesque deity known as the God of All Things Sharp. Twenty years later, <i>The Nightrunners</i> retains its ability to awe and to horrify. Six short stories that grew out of the novel, one previously unpublished, round out the volume.

There wasn&#x2019;t time for that. The coming storm was written in every distant flash of lightning, and in the sick, heavy clouds hanging over the ocean. The pelicans flying by in tight formation groaned in warning. Even the air tasted strange and unnatural. </p><p>So how had Kyte, Guardian of the Wind, missed it completely?</p><p>Usually Kyte predicted storms a day in advance. He&#x2019;d tell us how strong the wind would be. With a Guardian of the Water, he&#x2019;d warn how high the ocean would rise. And though I found it hard to imagine the clear blue sky roiling with clouds, and the usually calm ocean turned inside out, I knew better than to doubt him. It was his element, after all.</p><p>&#x201c;Swell rising,&#x201d; yelled Kyte. He crouched beside a stick planted firmly in the sand. It marked the highest point he expected the ocean to reach. As everyone turned to look, the water washed right over it and dragged it out to sea. </p><p>He closed his eyes. Tension carved lines in his face. He was engaging his element, but it had never looked so difficult before.</p><p>&#x201c;Wind speed increasing,&#x201d; shouted another Guardian.</p><p>&#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s <i>my</i> element,&#x201d; exclaimed Kyte, as though he owned the wind itself, not just the ability to read it.</p><p>Meanwhile, my father stood side by side with my older brother, Ananias, at the colony&#x2019;s rainwater harvester. They looked alike: same thick, dark hair and serious expression. They conjured sparks from their fingertips, tiny flames that grew and combined into a white-hot glow. Ananias directed the heat onto a bent nail while our father straightened it and drove it back into the oak paneling. However bad the storm might be, we couldn&#x2019;t afford to lose our only water source.</p><p>All the Guardians were busy now, their elements in full effect. As the first and only child born without an element, I watched them enviously. I couldn&#x2019;t summon fire, unearth food, predict storms, or catch fish barehanded. But I could toss sandbags against the stilts supporting our cabin, and so I did&#x2014;one after another, as my arms burned and sweat poured down my forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be loading the evacuation canoes, Thomas?&#x201d; Kyte&#x2019;s voice was low and threatening.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice is taking the last bags now,&#x201d; I said, pointing to the girl sprinting across the beach&#x2014;sure-footed and powerful&#x2014;two bulky canvas bags slung across her shoulders.</p><p>He followed my eyes, and shouted: &#x201c;Do you like having to do everything yourself, Alice?&#x201d;</p><p>As she turned her head, the wind tousled her dark hair. She peered at Kyte from the corner of her eye, but she didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking to you, Alice!&#x201d;</p><p>She dropped the bags. &#x201c;Does it matter what I like?&#x201d; Her eyes drifted to me, and she cocked an eyebrow. &#x201c;Anyway, you&#x2019;ve spent years trying to keep Thom and me apart. Why do you want him to help me now?&#x201d;</p><p>Kyte&#x2019;s face reddened. &#x201c;How dare you speak to a Guardian like that? You&#x2019;re not an Apprentice yet, remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I hope I never will be.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Are we done now?&#x201d;</p><p>The other Guardians stopped what they were doing, and watched with interest. Kyte obviously knew it too. He&#x2019;d have to take action&#x2014;punish Alice yet again&#x2014;just to save face. It was all so predictable.</p><p>Couldn&#x2019;t we have just one afternoon without Alice battling the Guardians head-on, when she could be spared their pointless attempts to tame her? The storm would be upon us soon. There wasn&#x2019;t time for this.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you think you missed this storm, Guardian Kyte?&#x201d; I asked. The words came out quickly, a thinly veiled attempt to distract him. &#x201c;Since your element is wind.&#x201d;</p><p>Kyte&#x2019;s mouth twisted into a mocking smile. &#x201c;Why? Did you foresee it before me, Thomas? Did you just forget to mention it to us?&#x201d;</p><p>I sensed the Guardians&#x2019; stares shifting to me. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t meaning to criticize. It&#x2019;s just strange. Almost like your element <br>didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Like my element didn&#x2019;t <i>what</i>?&#x201d; Kyte lifted a sandbag as though it weighed nothing and launched it several yards. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d think that you of all people would have more respect for the elements.&#x201d;</p><p>Without a sound, my younger brother, Griffin, joined me. Being deaf, he&#x2019;d learned to read the Guardians&#x2019; body language better than anyone. Having him beside me should have been a warning to say nothing. But I&#x2019;d only spoken up to save Alice.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you think now is the time for that?&#x201d; Kyte raised his hands toward the darkening sky. &#x201c;Some of us have work to do, and not enough time to do it. Can you at least respect <i>that</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>My pulse raced. Anger coursed through me. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t be in such a hurry if you&#x2019;d predicted the storm like you&#x2019;re supposed to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Until you have something to offer this colony,&#x201d; he spat, &#x201c;I suggest you keep your thoughts to yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; echoed my father. I hadn&#x2019;t heard him approach. He placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder, but his voice was loud and fierce. He fixed his eyes on Kyte. &#x201c;After all, those with elements should always be allowed to speak.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True. And if Thomas discovers an element, I&#x2019;ll be sure to listen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how do you suggest he finds one?&#x201d;</p><p>Kyte shrugged, but the mocking smile was back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult, for sure. Especially so late in childhood.&#x201d;</p><p>My father&#x2019;s grip tightened. Pain swept through me. &#x201c;As things stand, he&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you say,&#x201d; returned Kyte smoothly. <i>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;</i></p><p>I felt anger flash through my father&#x2019;s claw-like fingers&#x2014;sharp enough to make me wince&#x2014;and then he pulled away. I waited for him to come to my defense again, to match Kyte word for word. He&#x2019;d supported me for sixteen years. I expected nothing less now. But when I looked at him, it was as if he was done fighting. Or worse, as if he agreed with Kyte.</p><p><i>Nothing.</i> The word hung in the air like a fork of lightning seen long after it has vanished. Of course it was difficult for Father to have a son with no element&#x2014;it was even harder for me&#x2014;but he&#x2019;d always told me to be patient. Had he been lying all those years? Was <i>this</i> how he really felt?</p><p>There were only fifteen people in our colony, but every single one of them stood still and silent, eyes fixed uneasily on the ground. </p><p>My hands balled into fists by my sides. My heart beat wildly. <i>I can throw insults too,</i> I thought. I could&#x2019;ve asked Kyte why his weather predictions were increasingly unreliable. I could&#x2019;ve asked my father why his element was so much weaker than his oldest son&#x2019;s.</p><p>But I didn&#x2019;t say anything. Because in the end, they still had an element, and I didn&#x2019;t. Something was better than nothing.</p><p>I kept my head up and began to walk&#x2014;quick, uneven strides that couldn&#x2019;t carry me away fast enough. My father called to me, but I didn&#x2019;t turn back. As soon as I crossed the dunes, I broke into a run. Sand slipped beneath me. I couldn&#x2019;t seem to get a grip on anything&#x2014;the earth, my pulse, my life.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t stop running until I reached the narrow woods that ran like a spine down the center of Hatteras Island. I placed my left hand against a pine tree and punched the trunk with my right. Mosquitoes landed on me, and I didn&#x2019;t flick them away. I closed my eyes and welcomed a different kind of pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>I spun around. Alice stood before me, bags still hanging from her shoulders. She must have run too, but she didn&#x2019;t even seem out of breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Liar.&#x201d; Her blue eyes blazed. She was a year younger than me, but that was easy to forget when she was angry. &#x201c;Ignore them, Thom. Ignore them all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy for you to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why? Because I have an element, and you don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; She snorted. &#x201c;I can barely conjure a spark, let alone make a fire. It&#x2019;s a pathetic excuse for an element, and you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s something.&#x201d;</p><p>She dropped the bags and folded her long tan arms. Sinewy muscles showed through the dull coat of white sand. &#x201c;When are you going to start fighting back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just did, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean for me, or Griffin. I mean for <i>you</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who should I be fighting? Kyte?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone. Everyone. Go ahead and hurt them. Do it so they&#x2019;ll never look at you the same way again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that how you got so popular?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice just smiled. &#x201c;See? So much anger inside you. You need to let it out.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a rustle behind us. A girl stood beneath the canopy of a young tree. She fingered the ends of her long blond hair anxiously.</p><p>Alice huffed. &#x201c;What a surprise. I didn&#x2019;t expect Kyte to send you so soon, Rose. I figured he had more important things to do than worry about Thom and me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My father didn&#x2019;t send me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Course not.&#x201d; Alice retrieved her bags and walked away. She didn&#x2019;t look back.</p><p>Once Alice was out of sight, Rose knelt down on a bed of pine needles. She tugged the ends of her white tunic toward her knees, but the material rode up again. Her skin was smooth and pale, unblemished by scars. &#x201c;My father shouldn&#x2019;t say those things to you,&#x201d; she murmured, voice almost lost on the wind.</p><p>I sat down with my back against the trunk. &#x201c;Have you told him that?&#x201d;</p><p>She looked away. Suddenly I felt guilty instead of angry. </p><p>&#x201c;Alice doesn&#x2019;t think an element is important,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s wrong. If I had yours&#x2014;if I could read water the way you do&#x2014;everything would be different.&#x201d;</p><p>Unlike Alice, Rose didn&#x2019;t disagree. I was grateful for that. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find your element,&#x201d; she said, summoning a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you keep saying that? You swam like a fish before you could walk. Elements reveal themselves early. Not when you&#x2019;re sixteen.&#x201d;</p><p>Her smile never faltered. &#x201c;Look at your brother. Griffin&#x2019;s right leg doesn&#x2019;t work properly. He has ears, but he can&#x2019;t hear. Maybe you have an element, and it just doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;</p><p>I wanted to believe her, but I&#x2019;d already passed the age of Apprenticeship. There would be no silver lining to the cloud that had followed me my entire life.</p><p>A gust of wind bent the trees and scattered the needles. The first drops of rain came with it.</p><p>&#x201c;I believe in you, Thomas,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Always have. I want you to know that.&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment, she held my gaze, and I knew that she was telling the truth. I might be nothing to the colony, but I mattered to Rose. Her fingers drifted to the wooden bangle on her left wrist. She twisted it around and around. It was what she always did when she was nervous.</p><p>She had carved the bangle herself. Just as she&#x2019;d sewn the band of white cloth that held her hair back from her face, and the pretty linen tunic that fit her so differently than the ones stitched together by the Guardians.</p><p>My pulse quickened again, but this time there was no hint of anger. Instead I felt something even more powerful. Something I&#x2019;d been feeling more and more over the past two years. Something that left me as empty as having no element.</p><p>&#x201c;We should go,&#x201d; I said quickly, before my face gave me away.</p><p>I pulled myself up and offered my hand to Rose. She didn&#x2019;t take it, though. Then again, no one but my father touched me, or held me. It was as if having no element was contagious. And who could risk losing their greatest power?</p><p>Rose stood now. She was much shorter than me, but looking at her was like watching myself: same unsure expression, same way of shuffling her feet like she wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do with them. Was she thinking the same thing as me too? Deep down, did she want to touch me as much as I wanted to touch her?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said, breaking the connection. &#x201c;We should go.&#x201d;</p><p>No. An element wasn&#x2019;t the only thing I&#x2019;d never have.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Three canoes sat on the creek, filled with bags of supplies and fresh water in canisters&#x2014;enough for an overnight stay in the hurricane shelter. Usually I&#x2019;d have been dreading a trip to the smelly, sweaty shelter on Roanoke Island, two miles to the west. Not this time, though. For once I could only think of getting away&#x2014;from the Guardians&#x2019; stares, and my father&#x2019;s lies, and the colony that felt smaller every day.</p><p>With a lingering gaze at me, Rose climbed into the front of the canoe on the left. Her brother, Dennis, the youngest member of the colony at nine years old, joined her. He pressed his hands against his head as if it hurt. Rose rubbed his back gently.</p><p>Alice already sat at the helm of the middle canoe. She rolled up the sleeves of her dirty, misshapen blue tunic, and grasped the paddle tightly, eager to get moving. As her older sister, Eleanor, shared yet another embrace with their father, Alice rolled her eyes. Or perhaps that gesture was intended for her grandmother, Guardian Lora, who sat in the middle of the sisters&#x2019; canoe and complained to nobody in particular that the rain was increasing. The other Guardians claimed that Lora was coming along to look after us, but we all knew it was because she was too old and frail to ride out the storm in the colony.</p><p>I followed Lora&#x2019;s eyes to the clouds. We&#x2019;d never set off so late before. I wondered if we&#x2019;d make it across before lightning hit. If I&#x2019;d had the element of wind, I&#x2019;d have known the answer. If I&#x2019;d had the element of water, I&#x2019;d have been attuned to the swell, the tempo of the incoming tide.</p><p>I had nothing.</p><p>I took my usual place at the rear of our oak canoe. It tilted from side to side, but I barely noticed. We spent so much of our lives on water that the constant movements felt as familiar as the gentle give of sand on the beach. Griffin sat in the middle and faced me so that he could communicate with his hands during the crossing. </p><p>Meanwhile, in the bow seat up front, Ananias conferred with our father. He spoke with the confidence of a boy who&#x2019;d been treated as an adult for years&#x2014;though he was only eighteen. When they were done, Father waded toward Griffin and me. He paused beside Griffin, but when he leaned forward, it was me he hugged. He gripped my hair between his fingers and held me tight.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he whispered fiercely. &#x201c;You have no idea how ...</p></p><h2>Emergence of the Psychic</h2><p>This book aims primarily to help the reader become aware of the influence and action of the soul in life and then to describe and clarify the various states of consciousness that pertain to the experiences of the soul.

Somebody is secretly determined to turn the film into a flop. The movie's title adds an ominous twist to the case when Bess falls for its very attractive star -- one of Nancy's prime suspects! </p><p> Meanwhile . . . </p><p> FRANK and JOE HARDY are also in Quebec for the Winter Carnival's spectacular auto ice-racing event. But they soon find themselves in a race of their own -- to catch a murderer! Racing champion Andre Junot has turned up dead. At the same time a photographer from the movie set has turned up missing. Nancy, Frank, and Joe form a single resolution: infiltrate the criminal conspiracy... </p><p> <i>Tourist Trap</i> </p><p></p></p><p><p> <b>I</b> think Quebec must be the most romantic city on earth," said Bess Marvin, her blue eyes wide with excitement. "I can't believe we're going to spend New Year's Eve here <i>and </i>get to watch a movie being made." </p><p> </p><p> "I thought Christmas was over two days ago," said Nancy Drew, "but coming here is the best present of all." </p><p> Both girls had dressed in jeans and heavy sweaters under their parkas, but an icy breeze still chilled them. Nancy tugged her blue beret farther down over her reddish blond hair and moved her long, slender legs to keep them warm. Bess was completely bundled up in a violet parka and pink scarf, hat, and mittens. Only her blue eyes and red nose were visible beneath a fringe of blond hair. </p><p> "It's so great to get to see Emily, too," said Bess. She waved to a tall, slender woman with large brown eyes, who was talking to one of the camera crews. "I'm glad she thought to call us when they started having all those accidents on the set." </p><p> Nancy nodded. "You guys were so busy catching up on each other's lives that we still don't know what's really going on," she teased, pulling the collar of her red down jacket tighter around her neck. </p><p> Nancy and Bess had flown to Quebec, Canada, that morning after Bess's second cousin, Emily Anderson, had called. Emily had started working in television a few years earlier. Now she was the production coordinator for <i>Dangerous Loves, </i>a Canadian/American television movie about a young French Canadian woman who falls in love with a champion race car driver. </p><p> All Nancy knew so far about the trouble on the set was that the filming was behind schedule and way over budget because of a series of setbacks -- wrong costumes being delivered, camera dollies that suddenly didn't work, lights falling and breaking. The accidents weren't serious, but there had been enough of them that Emily had become suspicious. </p><p> "Just look at that view!" Bess exclaimed, gesturing up and over Nancy's shoulder with a mittened hand. </p><p> Nancy glanced back from the bank of the frozen river where she and Bess were standing. Behind them a steep slope led up to the stone walls that encircled Quebec's old Upper Town. Quebec had first been colonized in the 1600s, and the Upper and Lower towns resembled drawings of medieval towns. </p><p> "The city is gorgeous," Nancy agreed, wishing she could share it with her boyfriend, Ned Nickerson. "But right now I'm more interested in what's going on down here, on the set." She gestured to the dozen or so recreational vehicles that served as dressing rooms, offices, and equipment rooms for the movie company. </p><p> "What do you suppose they're doing now?" Bess asked. </p><p> Fifty yards away, out on the frozen surface of the river, members of the film crew were placing bright orange traffic markers. </p><p> Emily broke off from talking with one of the crew members and started toward Bess and Nancy. She was wearing a black hooded parka with <i>Dangerous Loves </i>embroidered across the back in red and white. Her name was stitched across the front. </p><p> "Brr!" Emily said, tightening the drawstring on her hood. "I can't stand this cold. I still haven't gotten used to it." </p><p> "I'm too excited to be cold," Bess said. "What's happening out there now?" </p><p> "We're setting up for an ice-racing scene," Emily explained. "The movie takes place during Quebec's Winter Carnival, and ice racing is one of the Carnival's big events." </p><p> "Ice racing?" Nancy repeated. "You mean, with cars?" </p><p> Emily nodded. "I know, it sounds a little strange, but it's really exciting to watch. I saw a test run yesterday, right here on the Saint Charles River." </p><p> "Saint Charles?" Bess echoed, sounding puzzled. "I thought the river in Quebec was called the Saint Lawrence. " </p><p> "That's what I thought, too," Emily said, laughing. "But the Saint Lawrence is over there to the right. The icebreakers keep it open most of the winter, so you can't drive a car on it. This is the Saint Charles. It's a lot smaller." </p><p> "Is the ice really thick enough to support cars?" Bess asked, dubiously staring out at the river. </p><p> A worried look crossed Emily's face. "I hope so. Our local experts say there are only a few spots we have to avoid." </p><p> Nancy pointed to a nearby sign marked Danger. "You mean, like that one?" </p><p> Emily nodded. "Uh-huh. Somebody told me that there's a spring under that patch of ice, so it doesn't freeze as quickly. You see how it's a lighter color, sort of bluish? But out in the middle, where they're marking off the race course, there shouldn't be any problems. " </p><p> "I hope not," Bess said. "You've already had more than your share of accidents on this film." </p><p> "We sure have," said Emily. "I'm counting on you and Nancy to find out why, and stop them." </p><p> Nancy was about to ask a few questions, but just then someone shouted for Emily. </p><p> "Oops, that's David Politano, the director," Emily said. "I'd better run. David's a very talented guy, but he's got a temper you wouldn't believe. I didn't tell him the reason I wanted you guys on the set, by the way. He did agree to let me ask you up, but he didn't much like the idea. Stay out of his way if you can. " </p><p> "We will," Bess promised. </p><p> Emily walked carefully across the ice toward a group of people. At the center of the group was a short, stocky man in his forties whom Nancy assumed was David Politano. His black hair was pulled back into a small ponytail, and a long, bright red scarf was wrapped around his neck. Nancy was too far away to hear what the director was saying, but he was obviously giving a series of orders. </p><p> Finally, he clapped his hands once and shouted, "Places!" </p><p> A young woman lifted a bullhorn to her mouth and repeated, "Places, please!" </p><p> "Look, there's Dennis Conners," Bess whispered, tugging excitedly on Nancy's arm. "He's the male lead. Isn't he luscious? I saw him on TV in 'Thunderstruck,' but he's even more gorgeous in real life." </p><p> Nancy found herself agreeing with Bess -- Dennis Conners <i>was </i>luscious. He was fairly tall, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. His black hair and black eyebrows made a striking contrast to his pale skin and startling blue eyes. He was wearing a white coverall and a thick down parka. </p><p> Nancy heard a click and a whir behind her. Glancing back, she recognized tall, lanky Jack Parmenter, Emily's boyfriend. He was the still photographer for the film crew. His job was to take pictures that could be used later for publicity. </p><p> He lowered his camera and raked a hand through his spiky blond hair as he surveyed the scene. He gave Nancy and Bess a wink. Then he followed Dennis out onto the ice, snapping pictures as he went. </p><p> "Wow," said Bess. "Check out that car!" A bright red race car was being wheeled into position, about thirty feet from where Nancy and Bess were standing. All the window glass had been removed, Nancy saw, and a row of steel bars installed in place of the windshield. </p><p> Dennis, standing by the driver's side of the car, put on a crash helmet. Then he grabbed the upper edge of the door and did a feet-first jump through the window opening. </p><p> "Why did he do that?" Bess wondered aloud. </p><p> A man standing a few feet from them over heard. "The doors are welded shut," he explained. "For safety." </p><p> Bess frowned. "Doesn't that make it hard to get out, if anything goes wrong?" </p><p> The man shrugged. "They figure the driver is usually better off inside the car. He wears a lot of protective gear, you know." </p><p> "Silence, please," the bullhorn sounded. "Silence on the set!" </p><p> Emily rejoined Nancy and Bess as a young man stepped forward with a clapper board and said, <i>"Dangerous Loves, </i>scene thirty-eight, take one. And . . . <i>action!" </i></p><p><i> </i>Dennis pulled himself out of the car until he was sitting in the window. He unbuckled his helmet and took it off, triumph written all over his face. Then he looked to the left, and his expression changed to one of anger. </p><p> While one of the cameras caught Dennis's expression in a close-up, another camera dollied in toward the front of the race car. Nancy looked where the camera was pointed. A lovely young woman was standing close to another driver. Her light brown hair fluffed out around her face like a halo. Her hand was on his arm. </p><p> "That's Marguerite Laforet," Emily whispered to Nancy and Bess. "She plays the female lead, a French Canadian lawyer. The guy she's talking to plays her ex-boyfriend in the movie. He and Dennis are racing rivals." </p><p> Just then Nancy was distracted by the roar of a souped-up engine. She turned in time to see a purple-and-gold race car round one of the many bends in the river. It sped straight for the film crew. </p><p> "Uh-oh," Emily said, frowning. "That's not in the script. Who is that idiot? He's going to ruin the scene." </p><p> <i>"Cut!" </i>Politano yelled. "Whose car is that? Get him off my set!" </p><p> The approaching car began to slide sideways across the ice, right toward Dennis's car. The actors and crew members scattered. Only Jack stood his ground and snapped one shot after another. </p><p> Just when it seemed that nothing could prevent a terrible crash, the car spun around twice and came to a stop, only a few feet from Dennis's car. A moment later the driver, a man with shaggy brown hair, a square face, and a nose that looked as if it had been broken more than once, climbed out. He gave the shaken crowd a smug smile. </p><p> "Good morning, everyone," he said, in a thick French Canadian accent. "I have come to see you work and let you profit of my expert counsels." </p><p> "Now, listen to me, Junot," Politano shouted angrily. </p><p> "This looks like trouble," Emily murmured. "I'd better get over there." </p><p> Nancy pulled Bess onto the ice behind Emily. "Come on, we don't want to miss anything important." </p><p> "Good morning, Monsieur Politano," Junot said, with a taunting grin. </p><p> "Junot, I told you yesterday, no deal," Politano said loudly. "I don't care if you <i>are </i>the ice-racing champion of Quebec. You can do stunt driving for us, as we agreed. But we don't need another technical advisor. We have an excellent one already, Francois Volnay." </p><p> Junot gave a loud sniff. "Volnay?" he said. "A good driver once, before his accident. Now he is good for nothing." </p><p> "I understand why they call you Snake, Andre." Someone in a deep voice had spoken. A tall, thin man of about thirty limped forward. "You hide in the grass, like a snake," the man continued. "Then, when you are sure it is safe, you strike." </p><p> "Remember who you are, old man, and who I am," Junot replied with a sneer. "And remember, too, that when these Yankees finish their work and leave Quebec, Volnay, you will again be nothing, but I will still be the champion. " </p><p> "We shall see," Francois Volnay said, but Nancy noticed that his face had reddened. He turned and limped back to the riverbank. </p><p> "Now, listen here -- " Nancy heard Politano begin to tell Junot. Her attention was distracted, however, as another car, a sleek-looking sedan, drew near on the ice. The driver carefully skirted the orange markers and came to a stop a dozen feet from the crowd. All four doors opened. A man with a gray mustache, wearing a fur cap, got out of the passenger seat. Another man, in a leather jacket and beret, climbed out from behind the wheel. </p><p> From the backseat two teenage guys got out and studied their surroundings with interest. </p><p> Nancy stared at them, looked away, and then snapped her head back as she realized who they were. </p><p> "Nancy, look!" Bess exclaimed. "Isn't that Frank and Joe Hardy? What are <i>they </i>doing in Quebec?" </p><p> There was no mistaking handsome Frank Hardy's six-foot-one frame, dark hair and dark eyes, or the slightly shorter, more muscular build of his blond, blue-eyed brother, Joe. </p><p> "And in a car in the middle of the Saint Charles River," Nancy added with a smile. </p><p> The Hardys were walking with the two older men, but they stopped when they spotted Nancy and Bess. </p><p> A grin lit up Joe's face as he and Frank hurried over. "Hey, what are you doing here?" he asked, as the boys gave Nancy and Bess big hugs. </p><p> "We were just wondering that about you," said Bess. </p><p> "We came up this morning to get a behind-the-scenes look at ice racing," Frank explained. </p><p> Nancy felt the familiar thrill as he bent to kiss her cheek. She knew nothing would ever happen between them because she had Ned, and Frank had a girlfriend, Callie Shaw. </p><p> "Henri Dussault, the man in the fur hat," Frank went on, "is an old friend of our dad's. </p><p> He invited us to stay with him for a week of R and R. Dussault Motors, his company, sponsors the ice race during Winter Carnival, in February." </p><p> "The guy with him is Pierre Desmoulins, " Joe added. "He's coordinating the February race, and he and Henri are planning the race course now." </p><p> With a laugh, Frank added, "None of us realized we'd end up in the middle of a movie set." </p><p> "Hey, listen," Joe said. "We're planning to get a few days' skiing in the Laurentian Mountains while we're here. Why don't you guys come, too?" </p><p> Nancy glanced around to make sure no one was listening. Then, lowering her voice, she said, "We're here on a case." </p><p> Frank raised an eyebrow. "Got it," he said quietly. "Why don't you come and meet Henri and Pierre?" </p><p> Nancy didn't respond. She was looking past the Hardys at the tense scene between Junot and Politano a dozen yards away. </p><p> Henri Dussault, Joe and Frank's host, had his hand on Junot's shoulder and he was talking to the race car driver in a low voice. Junot, sullen and stubborn-looking, finally nodded. He climbed back into his car and backtracked across the ice the way he'd come. </p><p> "Well, that's a relief," Bess said. "I wonder if Mr. Politano is planning to shoot that scene now or wait until after lunch." </p><p> The director had turned away and was walking across the ice toward the riverbank. </p><p> Nancy followed him with her eyes. "Bess?" she said urgently, scanning the ice. "Do you remember where that patch of thin ice was?" </p><p> "Sure," Bess said. "Right behind the Danger sign." </p><p> "Great, " Nancy said. "I see a patch that looks bluish, but I don't see any sign there now. And David is heading straight for it!" </p><p> Nancy opened her mouth to yell a warning, but the sound was drowned out by a loud cracking sound. As Nancy watched, horrified, David Politano tried to jump back, but a web of cracks appeared in the ice under his feet, and he lost his balance. </p><p> Bess screamed as the director fell backward. A series of popping noises rang out into the crisp, cold air, and water began seeping through the cracked ice under his feet. David Politano's body was flat on the cracking ice, but his boots were soon covered with water. </p><p> Within seconds, all the ice would break and his whole body would plunge into the frigid river! </p><p></p></p><h2>Kiss Her Goodbye (Hard Case Crime)</h2><p>Accused of murdering his wife and daughter, Joe Hope, an enforcer for a notorious loan shark, will stop at nothing to prove his innocence, and, with the help of Scotland&#39;s hardest men and one woman, exacts deadly revenge against the man responsible for these crimes.

He is also the creator of the Noir Originals website and commissioning editor for both Point Blank Press and the Pulp Originals line of e-books. Guthrie lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, on whose mean streets his books are set.Scottish author Guthrie's second novel (after <i>Two-Way Split</i>) lives up to Hard Case's reputation for gritty noir thrillers that pull no punches; as with other books in the series, it can be difficult to find a single likable character. Joe Hope supplies strong-arm for the thuggish Cooper, an Edinburgh loan shark. The two have just come in from a night of breaking bones with baseball bats when Joe learns that his beloved daughter, Gemma, has committed suicide. His anger immediately turns to wife Ruth's cousin Adam, who runs a writer's retreat, to which Gemma moved years earlier. Joe resented seeing his daughter leave home and charged Adam with protecting her. But when Joe goes to exact vengeance on Adam, he finds himself arrested for murder--Ruth's murder. Joe and Adam become unlikely allies as an ugly frameup begins to emerge. Dark, possibly incestuous, secrets haunt the family's past; Adam's revelation of Gemma's diary sheds some light on them, but other secrets remain to be told before the inevitable, brutal showdown. This violent tale contains the sort of coarse language and emotional roughness that fans of this mystery line have come to expect. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Under her dilapidated porch, he finds more than he bargained for: the largest, ugliest, meanest dog he s ever encountered . . . and a Samsonite suitcase stuffed with cash and explosives. As Ash begins to investigate this unexpected discovery, he finds himself at the center of a plot that is far larger than he could have imagined . . . and it may lead straight back to the world he thought he d left for good.Suspenseful and thrilling, and featuring a compelling new hero, "The Drifter" is an exciting debut from a fresh voice in crime fiction."</p><p>Nicholas Petriereceived his MFA in fiction from the University of Washington, won a Hopwood Award for short fiction while an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, and his story At the Laundromat won the 2006 Short Story Contest in the &#34;The Seattle Review,&#34; a national literary journal.A husband and father, he runs a home-inspection business in Milwaukee. &#34;The Drifter&#34; is his first novel.&#34;<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br> There was a pit bull under the front porch and it didn&#x2019;t want to come out.<br><br> Young Charlie Johnson said, &#x201c;That dang dog&#x2019;s been there for weeks, sir. It already ate up all the cats and dogs around here. I can&#x2019;t even let my dang little brother out the front door no more.&#x201d;<br><br> The hundred-year-old house sat on a narrow lot on the edge of a battered Milwaukee neighborhood that, like the house, had seen better days. It was early November, not warm, not even by Wisconsin standards. The leaves had already fallen from the skeletal trees that towered overhead.<br><br> But the sun was out, which counted for something. And the sky was a high, pale morning blue. Not a morning for static. Not at all.<br><br> Peter Ash said, &#x201c;Just how big is this dog?&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie shook his head. &#x201c;Never seen it up close, sir, and never in daylight. But it&#x2019;s awfully dang big, I can tell you that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you call animal control?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, my mama called,&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;Two men came, took one look under there, got right back in their truck and drove away.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie wore a school uniform, a light-blue permanent-press dress shirt, dark-blue polyester dress pants, and giant polished black shoes on his oversized feet. He was the kind of skinny, big-eared, twelve-year-old kid who could eat six meals a day and still be hungry.<br><br> But his eyes were older than his years. They didn&#x2019;t miss a thing.<br><br> He was watching Peter Ash now.<br><br> Peter sat on the closed lid of a wooden toolbox, his wide, knuckly hands on the work-worn knees of his carpenter&#x2019;s jeans, peering through the narrow access hatch cut into the rotted pine slats enclosing the space under the porch. He had to admit the dog sounded big. He could hear it growling back there in the darkness. Like a tank engine on idle, only louder.<br><br> He had a&nbsp;.45 under the seat of his pickup, but he didn&#x2019;t want to use it. It wasn&#x2019;t the dog&#x2019;s fault, not really. It was hungry and scared and alone, and all it had was its teeth.<br><br> On the other hand, Peter had told Charlie&#x2019;s mother, Dinah, that he would fix the rotting supports beneath her ancient porch.<br><br> She hadn&#x2019;t mentioned the dog.<br><br> Peter really couldn&#x2019;t blame her.<br><br> Her husband had killed himself.<br><br> And it was Peter&#x2019;s fault.<br><br>**<br><br> Peter was lean and rangy, muscle and bone, nothing extra. His long face was angular, the tips of his ears slightly pointed, his dark hair the unruly shag of a buzz cut grown wild. He had the thoughtful eyes of a werewolf a week before the change.<br><br> Some part of him was always in motion&#x2014;even now, sitting on that toolbox, peering under that porch, his knee bobbed in time to some interior metronome that never ceased.<br><br> He&#x2019;d fought two wars over eight years, with more deployments than he cared to remember. The tip of the spear. He&#x2019;d be thirty-one in January.<br><br> As he bent to look through the narrow access hatch under the porch, he could feel the white static fizz and pop at the base of his skull. That was his name for the fine-grained sensation he lived with now, the white static. A vague crackling unease, a dissonant noise at the edge of hearing. It wasn&#x2019;t quite uncomfortable, not yet. The static was just reminding him that it didn&#x2019;t want him to go inside.<br><br> Peter knew it would get worse before he was done.<br><br> So he might as well get to it.<br><br> The space under the porch was about three feet high. Maybe twelve feet wide and twelve deep, with a dirt floor. About the size of four freshly dug graves, laid sideways. The smell was rank, worse than a sergeant&#x2019;s feet after two months in a combat outpost. But not as bad as a two-week-old corpse.<br><br> Light trickled in through the slatted sides of the porch, but shadows shrouded the far corner, some kind of cast-off crap back there. And that growl he could just about feel through the soles of his boots.<br><br> It would be good to do this without being chewed on too much.<br><br> He went out to his truck and found a cordless trouble light, some good rope, and a length of old handrail. White oak, an inch and three-quarters thick, maybe eighteen inches long. Nice and solid in the hand. Which was a help when you were contemplating something spectacularly stupid.<br><br> Serenaded by the growls from the crawl space, he sat down on the toolbox and took out his knife while young Charlie Johnson watched.<br><br> Not that Peter wanted an audience. This certainly could get ugly.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have someplace to go, Charlie? School or something?&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie glanced at a cheap black digital watch strapped to his skinny wrist. &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not yet I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> Peter just shook his head. He didn&#x2019;t like it, but he understood. He figured he wasn&#x2019;t that far from twelve years old himself.<br><br> He cut three short lengths from his rope and left the remainder long, ten or twelve feet. Tied one end of a short piece of rope tight to each end of the oak rail. Looped the last short rope and the remainder through his belt a single time, so he could get at it quickly.<br><br> Then he looked up at Charlie again. &#x201c;You better get out of here, kid. If this goes bad, you don&#x2019;t want to be around.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a dang kid. Sir. I&#x2019;m the man of the family.&#x201d; He reached inside the door, brought out an aluminum baseball bat, and demonstrated his swing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my dang porch. My little brother, too. I ain&#x2019;t going nowhere.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie&#x2019;s dad always had the same look behind the Humvee&#x2019;s&nbsp;.50 turret gun. Eyes wide open and ready for trouble. Daring any motherfucker to pop up with an RPG or Kalashnikov or whatever. But when his wife, Dinah, sent cookies, Big Jimmy Johnson&#x2014;known inevitably to the platoon&#x2019;s jokers as Big Johnson, or just plain Big&#x2014;was always the last to eat one.<br><br> Peter missed him.<br><br> He missed them all. The dead and the living.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Okay, Charlie. I can respect that.&#x201d; He put his eyes on the boy and held them there. &#x201c;But if that dog gets loose you get your butt in that house, you hear me? And if you hit me with that bat I&#x2019;m going to be seriously pissed.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d; Charlie nodded. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t promise anything, sir. But I&#x2019;ll do my best.&#x201d;<br><br> Peter smiled to himself. At least the kid was honest.<br><br> After that there was nothing more to do but lean back and kick out the slats on one side of the porch, letting in more daylight. The space was still small. The tank engine in the shadows got louder. But no sign of the dog. Must be lurking in that trash pile in the far corner.<br><br> Not that it mattered. He wasn&#x2019;t turning away from the challenge. He was just planning how to succeed.<br><br> The familiar taste filled his mouth, a coppery flavor, like blood. He felt the adrenaline lift and carry him forward. It was similar to the static, rising. The body&#x2019;s preparation for fight or flight. It was useful.<br><br> He peered under the porch, and the static rose higher still. The static didn&#x2019;t care about the snarling dog. It cared about the enclosure. It jangled his nerves, raced his heart, tightened his chest, and generally clamored for his attention. It wanted him to stay outside in the open air, in the daylight.<br><br> Breathing deeply, Peter took the piece of oak and banged it on the wood frame of the porch. It rang like a primitive musical instrument.<br><br> Despite everything, he was smiling.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, dog,&#x201d; he called into the darkness. &#x201c;Watch your ass, I&#x2019;m coming in!&#x201d;<br><br> And in he went, headfirst on his elbows and knees, the stick in one hand and the trouble light in the other.<br><br> What, you want to live forever?</p><h2>Judy Hall&#39;s Complete Crystal Workshop</h2><p><br>From crystal expert Judy Hall comes a fascinating book that gives you a personalized, practical and direct experience of the thought-provoking wisdom that crystal exploration has conveyed to thousands throughout the world.

This ambitious volume comes at a time when Irish music and culture is experiencing a genuine renaissance, as evidenced by the popularity of such phenomena as Riverdance.</p> <p>Only a handful of books have attempted to present an overall picture of Irish traditional music, and many of these are now outdated or out of print. Since the late 1960s, the traditional music scene has changed radically: the commercial life of traditional music has mushroomed, bringing with it tremendous growth in what might be called music tourism. At the same time, an energetic revivalism has taken hold, the result of a wealth of new approaches to playing and spirited debate over the influence of traditionalism in Irish music.</p> <p>Fintan Vallely has harnessed the expertise of dozens of specialists who between them present a remarkably comprehensive picture of the field, incorporating ancient history, past ideals, and contemporary ideologies. The companion presents A-Z descriptions of individuals, traditions, and instruments, as well as an analysis of the modern history of traditional music-making. Biographical entries cover significant musicians and composers and central themes; central themes within traditional music, such as the oral tradition, the Bardic system, and the politics of Irish music, are given extended entries.</p> <p>Not just the ideal reference for the interested enthusiast, <b>The Companion to Irish Traditional Music</b> provides a unique resource for every home, school, or library with an interest in the distinctive rituals, qualities, and history of Irish traditional music and song.</p></p><p><p>An accomplished musician and music writer, <b>Fintan Vallely </b>lectures on Irish music and ethnomusicology at Maynooth College and is a regular reviewer and commentator for<i> The Irish Times</i> and numerous other papers.</p>Musician and musicologist Vallely and 110 other contributors from all over the world offer a rich assortment of facts and analyses regarding traditional Irish music and dance. The research spans history from the Bronze Age to the present, but the emphasis is on 20th-century people and practices. The A-to-Z arrangement of entries, which vary in length from a few words to 15 pages, also features black-and-white photographs, a few diagrams and maps, music samples, a chronology of important events in the development of Irish music, a bibliography of music collections and texts, and a discography of music and dance recorded on audio- and videotape. Most helpful are the concise, informative biographical entries and the lengthy pieces on instruments and playing styles, although some presume a familiarity with their subjects that few Americans have. Unfortunately, in an effort to cover anything and everything related to Irish music, the editor burdens the book with general statements on topics such as "gender" and "Irish bars" or universally used musical terms such as "triplet," detracting from the unique and valuable information it does provide.

Unlike most tours of the stars homes, the prime side of these mansions can be viewed from the water where they were photographed by Dykstra. From the Mercer Island Reporter: ''David Dykstra has published a truly unique book. The first of its kind, Dykstra recently completed 'Lake Washington 130 Homes,' a guide book to the lakeside mansions of the illustrious. Dykstra s guide book is not just a 'map to the stars' for Lake Washington; it s a document of history, geography and commercial industry.''</p><p>The author, David C. Dykstra, lives on Mercer Island waterfront and has extensively cruised, photographed and researched the lake and its waterfront estates. His previous books are &#39;&#39;Computers For Profit,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Easy Data Computer Comparisons&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Manager&#39;s Guide to Business Computer Terms.&#39;&#39; He has published numerous articles about computers and management information. David earned a BS in Chemical Engineering degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1963, an MBA degree from Harvard in 1966 and a California CPA license in 1977. In 1966 he started a career in accounting, finance and administration with Texas Instruments. His last major corporate position was Executive VP and CFO for TreeSweet Products Company in California. TreeSweet was a major U.S. producer of juice products that was later acquired (and its name disappeared) by NY-based Seneca Foods Corporation. In 1980 he started his own consulting firm in Newport Beach, California. He specialized in helping small and mid-sized business with their accounting and financial needs and converting to computer systems. He wrote numerous articles and two books based on his consulting experiences. In 1994, after 25 years in Newport Beach, he came to the Pacific Northwest on a consulting job and became a California to Washington State convert. He met his wife, Susan, and they were married in 2001. She has lived on Mercer Island waterfront for thirty-five years which is where they reside. He previously enjoyed cruising Newport Bay and a major delight was seeing the mansions that graced the shores. He recalls seeing John Wayne and other celebrities on their docks waving to the boating passersby. He transferred his cruising enthusiasm to Lake Washington which he enjoys even more because of the beauty of the lake&#39;s immense natural setting and wonderful large estates. In 1998 he recalls seeing Bill Gates with his new child in his arms standing on his dock and he friendlily waved to his group as they cruised by. Unfortunately, since 9/11 cruisers rarely see celebrity waterfront residents but they still enjoy seeing their homes and estates. During his cruises there were always discussions about the homes and who lived there. A lot of friends were knowledgeable but their information was limited and sometimes based upon secondary sources. His friends and relatives would often say, &#39;&#39;There should be a guide book about these homes&#39; physical statistics and history plus information regarding the present and past residents and owners.&#39;&#39; He was challenged, since he is a writer and photographer, to research the public information and produce such a book. He accepted this challenge. As he delved into the project he found many intriguing stories. The reviewers of the first drafts commented, &#39;&#39;Your statistics, current information, history and stories of the homes, their residents and the surrounding areas is fascinating reading for almost anyone not just the lake&#39;s boaters and cruisers. And your photographs bring all your written words to life.&#39;&#39; He expanded the initial scope to offer a book in a style that has never been used and will be interesting to a wide audience.</p><h2>Why Earls Fall in Love</h2><p><i>Society often makes strange bedfellows--and even more surprising betrothals...</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><b>IS IT A REASON FOR ROMANCE?</b><br>Young widowed Georgina Mowbray is settling into her role as Lady Russell's companion quite well--until the lady's nephew Dominic, the Earl of Coniston, arrives in Bath for a visit.

Time travel being what it is, she resigned herself to life with electricity and indoor plumbing, and read lots of books. When she's not writing, she's helping other people use books, as an academic librarian. Her books include <i>Why Dukes Say I Do</i> and <i>Why Lords Lose Their Hearts</i>.</p><i>One</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s extraordinarily ugly, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Mrs. Georgina Mowbray asked her friend, and fellow army widow, Mrs. Lettice Stowe, as they stood before the latest painting to have taken Bath by storm in the fashionable Messrs. Oliver and McHenry Art Gallery in Clarges Street. &#x201c;I do see that the artist has talent, but look at the expression on poor Cleopatra&#x2019;s face! She looks more like she&#x2019;s suffering from dyspepsia than the poisonous bite of an asp.&#x201d; <br>Lettice, who was rather less interested in art than Georgina, studied the painting, wrinkling her upturned nose in concentration. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said frowning, &#x201c;I rather like it. It&#x2019;s so dramatic, the way she&#x2019;s draping herself across the chaise, her bosom exposed as the asp sinks its fangs into her. And who&#x2019;s to say that the bite of an asp doesn&#x2019;t feel like an attack of dyspepsia. You remember old Mrs. Lafferty whose husband was with the 23rd, who swore she was only suffering a bit of the ague when in fact she was having an apoplexy.&#x201d; <br>Georgina had to concede the point to her friend, though she was fairly certain Mrs. Lafferty had been suffering from <i>both</i> the ague and apoplexy. But she didn&#x2019;t wish to quibble. Lettice was, after all, her only friend in Bath aside from her employer, Lady Russell, to whom Georgie served as lady&#x2019;s companion. <br>It had only been a few months since she&#x2019;d come to the spa town and she missed her friends in London dreadfully. But unlike Isabella and Perdita, who were both the widows of noblemen, Georgie was the widow of a military officer who had been just as terrible at managing his finances as he had been at being a husband. And as a result, she needed to work to earn her keep. <br>Today, her employer was taking tea with her niece while Georgie enjoyed her afternoon off. She would never have expected that the life of a paid companion would be so fulfilling, but it was. Georgie appreciated order and her life following the army had taught her to appreciate the well-managed life. Especially when her relationship with her husband had been anything but reliable. <br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Georgie allowed. &#x201c;Though I do still think it&#x2019;s a remarkably ugly painting.&#x201d; <br>Shuddering, she asked, &#x201c;Does it say who the artist is?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that would be me,&#x201d; said a male voice from behind them. A male voice she recognized.&#x201d; And I agree, it&#x2019;s a dreadful painting.&#x201d; <br>Georgina stifled a very unladylike curse before turning to greet the newcomer. Just as she&#x2019;d known he would be, the Earl of Coniston stood behind them, one supercilious brow raised in amusement. <br>He had been betrothed to her friend Perdita for a few short weeks earlier in the year, and during that time, Georgie had been forced to endure his company despite her dislike of him. He&#x2019;d been good enough to Perdita&#x2014;had even agreed to her dissolution of the betrothal without a fuss when she realized she wasn&#x2019;t ready to marry again so soon after her husband&#x2019;s death&#x2014;but from what Georgie could tell, he was the very sort of dissolute, devil-may-care nobleman that she&#x2019;d come to dislike during her time following the army. Especially given that the officers had often been handed their positions by dint of money and birth while the enlisted men under them were forced to do the real work. <br>And, perhaps sensing her dislike, Coniston, or Con as he was called by his friends, had found great delight in teasing her whenever they were in company together. <br>It was just Georgie&#x2019;s luck that he was her employer&#x2019;s favorite nephew, and would therefore be underfoot for her near future at the very least. <br>&#x201c;Lord Coniston,&#x201d; she said, masking her dismay with a smile, &#x201c;what a surprise to find you here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not so surprising, surely, Mrs. Mowbray,&#x201d; her nemesis said with a grin. &#x201c;After all, you must have penned the invitations for my aunt for her house party this week.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant,&#x201d; she said, maintaining her poise, &#x201c;this gallery, of course, not the city of Bath.&#x201d; It was just like him to deliberately misunderstand her. <br>Unchastened, he raised his brows. &#x201c;Do you mean you think me such a cultureless fribble that I could not possibly have business in such a place? For shame, Mrs. Mowbray. Surely, I have made a better impression upon you than that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As a matter of fact,&#x201d; Georgie began, before she was interrupted by Lettice. To her shame, Georgie had forgotten her friend was even there, such was the power of Coniston to overwhelm her good sense. <br>&#x201c;Do introduce me to your friend, Georgina,&#x201d; Lettice said, her eyes alight with interest as she took in Coniston&#x2019;s good looks and Georgie&#x2019;s discomfort in his presence. <br>Reluctantly, Georgie said, &#x201c;Lord Coniston, this is my friend Mrs. Lettice Stowe. We followed the drum together.&#x201d; Turning to Lettice, whose grin alerted Georgie to her amusement at the situation, she said, &#x201c;Lettice, this is Lord Coniston, the nephew of my employer, Lady Russell.&#x201d; <br>She would have liked to find fault in Coniston&#x2019;s reception of her friend, but Georgie was forced to admit that his bow and expression of pleasure at making the acquaintance were all that was proper. <br>&#x201c;What is it you dislike about this painting, my lord?&#x201d; Lettice asked, returning them to their surroundings. &#x201c;I should be interested to hear your opinion of it.&#x201d; <br>A dark curl brushed his brow, giving the earl a boyish air. &#x201c;Where to begin, Mrs. Stowe?&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;There are so many things wrong with it that I don&#x2019;t quite know which to condemn first. I will say, however, that it is obviously one of the artist&#x2019;s earlier works and doubtless he would prefer it to never be seen in public again. <br>&#x201c;I have told the owners of the gallery to remove it many a time,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;But they ignore my pleas to spare the good people of Bath from the horror of it.&#x201d; <br>Suddenly, a memory of her employer saying something about her nephew winkled its way into Georgie&#x2019;s consciousness. Closing her eyes, she bit her lip in frustration. Of course. <br>&#x201c;It <i>is</i> yours, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she asked the earl in a flat tone. He&#x2019;d overheard her criticizing his work. He&#x2019;d never let her hear the end of it. <br>To his credit, Coniston did not attempt to capitalize on her embarrassment. &#x201c;It is indeed, I am sorry to say,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;I gave it to a friend as a joke years ago, and the beastly fellow sold it to this gallery. Every time I come to Bath I attempt to buy it back from the owners but they refuse, claiming it&#x2019;s one of their most popular display pieces.&#x201d; <br>Georgie couldn&#x2019;t help but sympathize with him. &#x201c;How unfortunate,&#x201d; she said, looking once more at the hideous face of Cleopatra. &#x201c;You have become a much better artist since you painted this,&#x201d; she added, thinking how mortified she would be if one of her sewing samplers, which were truly awful, were to be hung up next to someone else&#x2019;s neat and tiny stitching. &#x201c;The landscape in your aunt&#x2019;s sitting room is particularly fine.&#x201d; <br>Coniston gave her a puzzled look, as if he weren&#x2019;t quite sure what to think of her when she was being generous with him. Georgie felt a tug of shame. Had she really been so difficult with him? she wondered. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad as all that,&#x201d; Lettice said, again reminding Georgie of her presence. &#x201c;I was just telling Georgie that&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>But before she could finish, they were interrupted by another gentleman. <br>&#x201c;There you are, old boy,&#x201d; the newcomer said, slightly out of breath. &#x201c;The others are waiting. Let&#x2019;s get out of this mausoleum.&#x201d; <br>It was clear from the man&#x2019;s glance at Georgie and Lettice, and his quick dismissal, that he did not consider them worth his notice. Coniston, to his credit, looked embarrassed at his friend&#x2019;s bad manners. <br>&#x201c;Ladies,&#x201d; he said, bowing to them, &#x201c;I hope you find some more pleasing works of art to occupy the rest of your time here. I recommend the very fine Tintoretto in the corner.&#x201d; <br>And with a grin, he followed his friend from the anteroom of the gallery where Georgina and Lettice stood looking after him. <br>As soon as he was out of earshot, Lettice unfurled her fan and briskly plied it before her face. &#x201c;Lord, Georgie, have you ever seen such a handsome man in your life? Why did you not tell me you were friends with him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s hardly a friend, Lettice,&#x201d; she responded with a laugh. &#x201c;He is my employer&#x2019;s nephew. We met in London at the home of a mutual friend, but to be honest we are not on the best of terms.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Lettice demanded. &#x201c;You seemed easy enough just now.&#x201d; <br>Georgie was silent for a moment as she tried to put into words her complicated feelings about Lord Coniston. He was friendly enough and had been kind to Perdita. But she found it difficult to admire a man who seemed to concern himself with nothing beyond the latest on-dit or the outcome of some much-talked-about prizefight. For better or for worse, she could not admire a man who was so lacking in seriousness. <br>&#x201c;You were in the war, Lettice,&#x201d; Georgie tried to explain. &#x201c;You saw how some of the aristocratic officers behaved.&#x201d; <br>At her friend&#x2019;s nod, she continued, &#x201c;Lord Coniston reminds me of them. As if he has nothing more to concern himself with than the betting book or which opera dancer he&#x2019;s going to bed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what,&#x201d; Lettice asked, with a frown, &#x201c;is wrong with that? Goodness, Georgina, you behave as if the war is still going on. So what if Lord Coniston enjoys himself. Wouldn&#x2019;t you love to have enough funds to live as you pleased? It&#x2019;s not as if he&#x2019;s leading men into battle and compromising their safety.&#x201d; <br>It was nothing more than she&#x2019;d told herself any number of times, and Georgie knew that Lettice was right on some level. &#x201c;True enough,&#x201d; she said with a shrug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure why I am so hard on him. Perhaps I am a bit jealous of his freedom to do as he wishes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you ask me,&#x201d; Lettice said with a sly look, &#x201c;you need to loosen your stays a bit, so to speak. Let yourself have a bit of fun. You&#x2019;re no longer following the drum, keeping everything neat and tidy for that brute of a husband to come back to from the fighting. And it&#x2019;s time you remembered it.&#x201d; <br>It was an old argument, and one that Georgie did not wish to rehash again. One of the ways in which she&#x2019;d learned to cope with the unpredictabilty of her husband&#x2019;s temper was to keep everything else in her life as predictable as possible. She lived her life by the ticking of the small heart-shaped watch pinned to the breast of her gown. And the one freedom she did appreciate was the one that allowed her to do so without reproach. <br>Looking down at her watch, she gasped. &#x201c;Goodness, it&#x2019;s gone three! I promised Lady Russell I&#x2019;d be back in time for tea.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought it was your day off?&#x201d; Lettice pouted, looking like a thwarted five-year-old. <br>Since Georgie didn&#x2019;t wish to explain again that she&#x2019;d agreed to giving up a bit of her off day under no duress and that she, in fact, had offered to do it, she remained silent. <br>&#x201c;I shall have to get back to Henrietta Street,&#x201d; she said, giving her friend a quick hug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at the Pump Room, tomorrow, all right?&#x201d; <br>To Georgie&#x2019;s great relief, her friend didn&#x2019;t raise a fuss. But before they parted ways on the street outside the art gallery, the other woman said, &#x201c;Just remember that your employer is not your friend, Georgina. She is your employer. It&#x2019;s just not possible for folks of their station and ours to be friends. Not true friends like we are.&#x201d; <br>It was an old argument, and rather than go into it for the umpteenth time, Georgie merely nodded and gave her friend another quick hug before hurrying down the street toward Lady Russell&#x2019;s town house. <br>She knew there was some sense in what Lettice said. But she&#x2019;d learned from her friendship with Isabella and Perdita that not all members of the <i>ton</i> were supercilious and cutting. And if truth be told, Georgie trusted the sisters more than Lettice in some instances, because though Lettice was a good enough person, she had a tendency to look for the cloud in every silver lining. And if Georgie needed anything it was to be around people with a sunny outlook on life, given her own tendency toward seriousness. <br>No sooner had the thought crossed her mind, however, than she remembered the letter in her reticule. She had reason for her worries, she reminded herself. <br>The first had arrived a month or so ago. And knowing the hell Isabella had gone through after she&#x2019;d received similar missives, Georgie was prepared for something terrible to befall her now that the second and third warning letters had arrived. <br> <i>I know what you did last season.</i> <br>The notes were unsigned. And she was quite sure if she compared her own letters with Isabella&#x2019;s that the handwriting would be identical. <br>Someone, she knew, was out to avenge the late Duke of Ormond&#x2019;s death. No matter how much of a brute he&#x2019;d been. No matter that his death had been a matter of preventing him from murdering Perdita before their very eyes. <br>Whoever was behind the threatening letters, Georgie knew that they weren&#x2019;t interested in fairness or logic or justice. They wanted only revenge. <br>On that thought, her hand slipped down to feel the reassuring shape of the small pistol resting next to the notes in her reticule. <br>Let this person continue to threaten, she thought grimly. When they began their campaign to frighten her, Georgie decided, she&#x2019;d be ready for them. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;Why are you here, Con?&#x201d; <br>The Earl of Coniston turned with a sense of resignation to see his cousin, Mr. Philip Callow, bounding toward the door of their aunt, Lady Russell&#x2019;s, Henrietta Street town house. He was fond enough of his cousin, but Philip had never been much in the brains department. <br>&#x201c;I should imagine,&#x201d; he said, tapping his riding crop against his boot, &#x201c;for the same reason you are here, Philip. To celebrate Aunt Russell&#x2019;s birthday.&#x201d; <br>Indeed, if what his sister had told him was true, Aunt Russell had invited all of her nieces and nephews to Bath for a week for her birthday celebration. Of course the spa town was not nearly as fashionable as it once was, having been superseded in the <i>ton</i>&#x2019;s affections by Brighton with its seaside bathing and lavish entertainments. There had been a bit of grumbling about the dullness of the locale, but as Aunt Russell was turning seventy and, moreover, had promised them all a sizable portion of her fortune upon her death, they each made the sojourn to Henrietta Street. <br>&#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Philip sighed. &#x201c;I was hoping she&#x2019;d decided to cut the rest of you out and leave the whole lot to me.&#x201d; He picked an invisible bit of fluff from his sleeve. &#x201c;Weston is cutting up rough over my bill again.&#x201d; <br>Con was not surprised to hear it. It was unfashionable to pay one&#x2019;s bills in a timely manner, and if Philip was anything it was fashionable. <br>&#x201c;Sorry to disappoint you,&#x201d; he said just as the door was opened by his aunt&#x2019;s ancient butler, Rigsby, who ushered them both into the narrow house and instructed a footman to see to the valets and bags. <br>&#x201c;The others are gathered in the drawing room,&#x201d; Rigsby said with a stiff bow, indicating that the two men should precede him. <br>But Con waved him off. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find our own way, Rigsby. We don&#x2019;t stand on ceremony with family, after all.&#x201d; <br>In the absence of his parents, who were more involved with one another than their only son, he&#x2019;d spent most of his holidays from school in Aunt Russell&#x2019;s house and was intimately acquainted with its layout. Even the secret passages that had been built into it by his long dead Uncle Russell&#x2019;s father. <br>&#x201c;Wonderful,&#x201d; his aunt said as they entered the room, which seemed filled to the rafters with his cousins and their spouses.

Among the toughies with serious cases were Lord Byron, Richard Wagner, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway. Symptoms include:<br><br> Wishing that the movie stars in films set in Venice would move aside so that you can get a better view of the scenery.<br> Wondering why people ask if you had good weather when you were thereas if rain could dampen your love.<br> Thinking that people who go to Tuscany or Provence must be nuts.<br> Believing that the "Per San Marco" street sign with arrows pointing in opposite directions makes perfect sense.<br> Consoling yourself when you leave by remembering the generations of Venetian merchants who, as they were borne away from Venice, vowed to be back as soon as they had more money.<br><br> There is no cure for this affliction. This is a guide to managing it. 35 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Judith Martin</strong>, born a perfect lady in an imperfect society, is the author of the &#x201c;Miss Manners&#x201d; columns and best-selling books, two novels, and a travel book on Venice. She and her husband live in Washington, DC.</p><p><strong>Eric Denker</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in the Education Department of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p>In a good-natured guide for die-hard "Venetophiles," author and etiquette guru Martin focuses not on the stunning Byzantine architecture of this Italian city but on the unique personality of Venetians themselves. While this fun-to-read paean to the sybaritic delights of la Serenissima offers a compelling window into the city's social history, it should come as no surprise that the author of Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior is most interested in schooling her readers on how to comport themselves in a city still long on Old World charm and cultural mores. Martin is quick to point out that even the most illustrious tourists (including former Venice visitors Tennyson, Tchaikovsky and Twain) need a bit of good-natured advice on how to present themselves ("Hat etiquette is strict") and interact with others ("Making poetic observations ... should be resisted at any cost"). Martin also dips an enthusiastic toe into the rich history of Venetian food and drink ("Veneto's prosecco is not just cheaper than champagne but better"), painting, poetry and party-going, making the book perfect for a swift, semi-intellectual overview of Venice that goes several steps deeper than the average tourist guide. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.Banks has woven a warm and funny story, rich with characters and adventures. An utterly enchanting piece of fiction...it marks a return to his brilliant best. NEW WOMAN This is Bank s&#39; finest novel yet. INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY Hip and sexy humour...Bank reinforces his credentials as one of the most able, energetic and stimulating writers we have in the UK. TIME OUT The Crow Road is tight with detail and closer observation and creates a strong sense of a particular period of growing up. THE INDEPENDENT Magic is the book&#39;s keynote. It echoes in descriptions of evolution that pass from the factual to the elegiac and on the mythical. It calls most insistently when intensity - of love, lust or grief - burst through limited expectations or circumstances to release poetry. THE TIMES Banks keeps death in its place, under the boot of wit which knows that the most significant romance can blossom whilst your youngest brother is up to the elbow in Sugar Smacks looking for the plastic toy. OBSERVER The tense horror of the book...is done with considerable imaginative subtlety and a fine touch...This is as fine and ambitious a novel as any from a Scottish writer since the 1960s. It is also unquestionable Bank&#39;s best work to date. NEW STATESMAN A magnificent, rambling family saga...his best novel yet.

We follow his life as he's driven from his home as a boy and walks, with thousands of orphans, to Ethiopia, where he finds safety &#x2014; for a time. Valentino's travels, truly Biblical in scope, bring him in contact with government soldiers, janjaweed-like militias, liberation rebels, hyenas and lions, disease and starvation &#x2014; and&nbsp;a string of unexpected romances. Ultimately, Valentino finds safety in Kenya and, just after the millennium, is finally resettled in the United States, from where this novel is narrated. In this book, written with expansive humanity and surprising humor, we come to understand the nature of the conflicts in Sudan, the refugee experience in America, the dreams of the Dinka people, and the challenge one indomitable man faces in a world collapsing around him.<br><br></p><p>"Dave Eggers has done something remarkable with this book. He has managed to cross many barriers both real and artificial to tell the story of one man's tragedy and triumph in a way that emphasizes his simple humanity above the drama of his terrible situation. It is a book that shows there is no reason why geographical and cultural divides should prevent us from attempting to understand each other as citizens of this world." <br>--UZODINMA IWEALA, author of Beasts of No Nation <p>"I cannot recall the last time I was this moved by a novel. What is the What is that rare book that truly deserves the overused and scarcely warranted moniker of `sprawling epic.' Told with humor, humanity, and bottomless compassion for his subject, one Valentino Achak Deng, Eggers shows us the hardships, disillusions, and hopes of the long suffering people of southern Sudan. This is the story of one boy's astonishing capacity to endure atrocity after atrocity and yet refuse to abandon decency, kindness, and hope for home and acceptance. It is impossible to read this book and not be humbled, enlightened, transformed. I believe I will never forget Valentino Achak Deng." <br>--KHALED HOSSEINI, author of The Kite Runner </p><p>"What is the What is a novel that possesses the best qualities of a documentary film: the conviction of truthfulness, and the constant reminder of the arbitrariness of fate, for worse and for better. By setting his story of African annihilation and survival as a story of American immigration, Eggers ensures that it belongs to us all, as it must." <br> --PHILIP GOUREVITCH, author of We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda </p><p>"I have been interacting with the Lost Boys since the late 1980s, from the time they were first displaced in Sudan to their arrival in the United States. I thought I had heard and seen it all. But reading Valentino's story has touched emotions in me I didn't even know I had.

This book contains practical, hands-on advice that shows the reader how to do it without property management companies, and keep 100 percent of the profits. It offers realistic strategies to create a situation in which renters pay the mortgage, while still allowing the owner several weeks a year in that little slice of paradise.</p><p>Now included is a wonderful FOREWORD by Broderick Perkins !!!I could not afford to buy a vacation property, but...I wanted one anyway. During my quest, I stumbled upon a vital loophole that rarely surfaces when looking to purchase vacation property "Renting by Owner." Unfortunately, there aren&#x2019;t many resources out there to provide much-needed answers on how to take advantage of this oft overlooked, and as I found out, important loophole. So I wrote this book to fill the void. I bought the vacation home of my dreams, and I spent more for it than I did for my primary residence. I have never regretted it. I had positive cash flow from day one. Others became curious and asked if I would share my knowledge. I did. Word of mouth spread, and I started giving seminars to teach people how to own a vacation property and rent it themselves. <p>These pages are filled not only with my own observations and experiences, but also with true stories I&#x2019;ve compiled from conversations with hundreds of owners. Over the years, they have opened up and shared with me their challenges and triumphs. I&#x2019;ve changed their names for privacy reasons, but you will find a treasure trove of wisdom in their anecdotes. Whatever situation you become involved with, fear not... you&#x2019;re not alone. The people I&#x2019;ve worked with have found innovative strategies that really work.

The central theme is the conflict between morality and expediency, and in this novel Koestler worked it out in terms of individual psychology. Peter Slavek starts out as a brave young revolutionary, but suffers a breakdown. On the analyst&#39;s couch he is made to discover, in Koestler&#39;s own words, &#39;that his crusading zeal was derived from unconscious guilt&#39;.</p><p>Arthur Koestler was born in Budapest in 1905. He attended the university of Vienna before working as a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, Berlin and Paris. For six years he was an active member of the Communist Party, and was captured by Franco in the Spanish Civil War. In 1940 he came to England. He died in 1983 by suicide, having frequently expressed a belief in the right to euthanasia.</p><h2>Landscape As Photograph</h2><p>This review of American landscape photography from the 1840s to the present features and comments on the work of more than fifty photographers</p><p></p><h2>Barns Of The Midwest</h2><p>For many, the barn is the symbol of the Midwestern United States.

This book examines the contrasting lives of Franz (1758-1840), who for 50 years was the resident artist at London's Kew Gardens and Ferdinand (1760-1826) who led a life of travel and adventure as a natural history artist including participating in the voyage to Australia of HMS Investigator (1801-1805). It is illustrated with images from the superb archive of Bauer drawings at the Natural History Museum Library, many of which have never been published. These include beautiful and finely detailed watercolors of flowering plants collected from across the world, pioneering microscopical drawings of plant anatomy, and pictures of the newly discovered animals from the coasts of Australia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Paul Martyn Cooper</b> is a special collections librarian at the Natural History Museum where he has worked for 28 years.

He's a consulting editor for TOR/Forge Books and lives in Canyonlands, Utah.Blevins is well known for fictionalizing the history of the American West in works like Stone Song: A Novel of the Life of Crazy Horse, but at the same time he is lauded for his accuracy. He maintains that, like any other subgroup in America, Westerners have a language all their own, and over time he has grown frustrated when his editors or readers did not understand his writing. The result is this dictionary, expanded and revised from the 1992 edition (Facts On File), which defines terms commonly used in the West. Many of the 5000-plus entries are new or rewritten, and the text pays greater attention to the Pacific Coast States, including Alaska. In addition, greater emphasis is placed on words from many of the minority groups influencing Western history, from Mormons to blacks, who are often overlooked in similar works. As a result, this dictionary is much more current than the venerable Western Words: A Dictionary of the American West (o.p.) or Western Words: A Dictionary of the Old West (Hippocrene, 1997), both by Ramon Frederick Adams. The engagingly written entries are arranged alphabetically and frequently include guides to pronunciation.

Very possibly the latter, argues the author of <i>They Have a Word for It</i>. "Finding a name for something," says Howard Rheingold, "is a way of conjuring its existence." While collecting words for this book, Rheingold says he "became sympathetic to the idea that we think and behave the way we do in large part because we have words that make these thoughts and behaviors possible, acceptable, and useful." Rheingold's refusal to pull together words for entertainment value alone--though many of these words, and Rheingold's commentary on them, are highly entertaining--is what has given this book (previously out of print) a kind of cult following. <p> Hawaiian contributes a word (<i>ho'oponopono</i>) here that means "solving a problem by talking it out"; Japanese, a term (<i>kyoikumama</i>) for a "mother who pushes her children into academic achievement"; Indonesian, a word (<i>kekaku</i>) meaning "to awaken from a nightmare"; and Mayan (some things, it seems, are universal), a concise way to say "stupid in-laws" (<i>bol</i>). While it is the Asian and obscure linguistic groups that seem to come up with the most "powerful" ideas, German wins for packing a whole sentence's worth of meaning into one (albeit long) word. How much happier Strunk and White would rest if we could just say <i>Torschl�sspanik</i> when discussing "the frantic anxiety experienced by unmarried women as they race against the 'biological clock'"; <i>Treppenwitz</i> when referring to the "clever remark that comes to mind when it is too late to utter it"; and <i>Schlimmbesserung</i> when lamenting "a so-called improvement that makes things worse." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>A reprint of the much-in-demand They Have a Word for It, by Howard Rheingold, is first on the list for a new series, The Writer&#x2019;s Studio. Sarabande Books, a nonprofit literary publisher of poetry and short fiction, began the new series to feature books that challenge, stimulate, and support the writer of poetry and short fiction.

In this book, Nidesh Lawtoo furthers his previous diagnostic of crowd behavior, identification, and mimetic contagion to account for the growing shadow cast by authoritarian leaders who rely on new media to take possession of the digital age. Donald Trump is considered here as a case study to illustrate Nietzsche&#x2019;s untimely claim that, one day, &#x201c; &#x2018;actors,&#x2019; <i>all kinds</i> of actors, will be the real masters.&#x201d; In the process, Lawtoo joins forces with a genealogy of mimetic theorists&#x2014;from Plato to Girard, through Nietzsche, Tarde, Le Bon, Freud, Bataille, Lacoue-Labarthe, and Nancy, among others&#x2014;to show that (new) fascism may not be fully &#x201c;new,&#x201d; let alone original; yet it effectively reloads the old problematics of mimesis via new media that have the disquieting power to turn politics itself into a fiction.</p><p><b>Nidesh Lawtoo</b> is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and English at KU Leuven in Belgium, as well as principal investigator of an interdisciplinary project funded by the European Research Council titled <i>Homo Mimeticus: Theory and Criticism</i>. He was previously visiting scholar in the Humanities Center at Johns Hopkins University, and he is the author of <i>Conrad&#x2019;s Shadow: Catastrophe, Mimesis, Theory</i> and <i>The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious</i>, which has been translated into Italian."Lawtoo&#x2019;s account is both incredibly enlightening and incredibly sobering as it forces us to face the mimetic beast in all of us, the old and new 'Man of the Crowds.'"<br> &#x2014;From the foreword by Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen<br><br>"Calmly, carefully, and courageously, Nidesh Lawtoo examines the rise of a 'reloaded' fascism in the United States and Europe. His diagnosis&#x2014;whose key figures include mimesis, myth, Girard, contagion, Bataille, Connolly, community, phantom egos, Dionysian identification, <i>partage</i>, Apollonian dream-states, and sacrifice&#x2014;is both lucid and fascinating. The book is a testament to the power of reasoning to unmask and resist cruel forms of affective contagion, even as it opens the door to the project of composing generous and laudable admixtures of pathos and logos.

But what happens before and after the surgery? In <i>Transplanting Care</i>, Laura L. Heinemann examines the daily lives of midwestern organ transplant patients and those who care for them, from pretransplant preparations through to the long posttransplant recovery.&nbsp;Heinemann points out that as efforts to control healthcare costs gain urgency&#x2014;and as new surgical techniques, drug therapies, and home medical equipment advance&#x2014;most of the transplant process now takes place at home, among kin. Indeed, the transplant system effectively depends on unpaid care labor, typically provided by spouses, parents, siblings, and others. Drawing on scores of interviews with patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals, Heinemann follows a variety of patients and loved ones as they undertake this uncertain and strenuous &#x201c;transplant journey.&#x201d; She also shows how these home-based caregiving efforts take place within the larger economic and political context of a paucity of resources for patients and caregivers, who ultimately must surmount numerous obstacles. The author concludes that the many snags encountered by transplant patients and loved ones make a clear case for more comprehensive health and social policy that treats care as a necessarily shared public responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;An illuminating look at the long transplant journey, <i>Transplanting Care</i> also offers broader insight into how we handle infirmity in America&#x2014;and how we might do a better job of doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>LAURA L. HEINEMANN is an associate professor of medical anthropology at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska."Succinct, convincing, and organized,&nbsp;<i>Transplanting Care</i>&nbsp;provides a thoughtful, ethnographically rich account of the day-to-day care involved in looking after transplant recipients before, during, and after their transplant surgeries."

To date, he has written more than 70 books of poetry and fiction - books that reveal a breathtaking range, from freshly minted trobar clus and contemporized sonnet forms, to epic-length narratives and non-narratives - such as Axon Dendron Tree, The Common Shore, The Loom, or the first two installments of a recent trilogy, Fire Exit &amp; Uncertainties. Just as compelling are the volumes of shorter lyric forms, such as Finding the Measure, Songs I-XXX, Not this Island Music, and Lapis, or his even more experimental work, such as Sentence, The Flowers of Unceasing Coincidence, or his writing-through of Shelley's poem, Mont Blanc. The deeper unity of the work is unavoidably present in the voice that underlies the multiplicity of forms. As Guy Davenport wrote: "A Kelly poem is a Kelly poem. It dances in his way, sings in his intonations, insisting on its style. No American poet except perhaps Wallace Stevens has his sense of balance in a line. [...] Kelly has nothing to hide: the untiltable balance is there to begin with." Less visible than the poetry, but certainly no less important, incisive, worth preserving &amp; circulating anew, are the trove of essayistic materials disseminated throughout numerous small &amp; not so small magazines of the second-half of the 20th C. The out-of-print 1971 In Time was Kelly's sole published book of essays properly speaking, even though he has been writing on his (&amp; others') poetry &amp; poetics since the early 60s. Long over-due, the present volume, A Voice Full of Cities, collects for the first time Kelly's essays, statements, &amp; other writings on poetry &amp; poetics, making available a vast array of difficult to obtain works. The editors' aim was to insure that - in Robert Kelly's own words - "the fifty years of thinking around the fifty years of making won't get lost, and making and thinking will be seen as one thing." A forthcoming companion volume from Contra Mundum Press, A City Full of Voices, will present critical essays on Robert Kelly's work by a wide range of contributors.</p><p>Poet and fiction writer, Robert Kelly was born in 1935 in Brooklyn, and educated at CCNY and Columbia, where he studied medieval literature and linguistics. His first book, <em>Armed Descent</em>, was published in 1961; since then he has published over sixty more, most recently the poetry collection <em>Opening the Seals</em>, UNCERTAINTIES (Station Hill Press of Barrytown, 2011), the novel <em>The Book from the Sky</em>, the long poem <em>Fire Exit</em>, and his fifth collection of short stories, <em>The Logic of the World</em>. He has been especially interested in collaborations with artists (<em>The Garden of Distances</em>, <em>Shame</em>) and other poets (<em>Mont Blanc</em>, <em>Unquell the Dawn Now</em>). He was a founder of <em>Chelse</em> and <em>Trobar</em>, and an editor of <em>Caterpillar, Alcheringa,</em> and <em>Conjunctions</em>. He is the Asher B. Edelman Professor of Literature at Bard College, where he started the writing program in the Milton Avery Graduate School. He co-directs the Program in Written Arts. He lives in the Hudson Valley with his wife, the translator Charlotte Mandell.</p><h2>Reclaiming Higher Ground: Creating Organizations that Inspire the Soul</h2><p>In this, his most thought-provoking book since <i>The Way of The Tiger</i>, Lance Secretan presents the chilling scenario that we've hit the wall with current management theory: we can't go on doing more of the same, only faster. Secretan deliberately puts forward more questions than answers as he guides us towards rediscovering our souls. The purpose? To make work part of our spiritual practice. And that's good for the heart, the mind -- and the bottom line.</p><p>Lance Secretan is not your conventional business consultant. A member of MENSA, he built a $100 million company from scratch by age 40 and then retired to work with other executives worldwide, conduct seminars, and write books about the route he believes will lead to real success. <i>Reclaiming Higher Ground: Creating Organizations That Inspire the Soul</i>--which pictures Secretan on the cover smiling broadly in dark suit, dark turtleneck, shaved head, and bare feet--is his manifesto for those seeking an alternative to the traditional corporate way of life. Secretan's ideas, combined with supportive examples from today's business world, are truly thought provoking.We are precariously poised at a moment of great danger and great hope. Reclaiming Higher Ground is a book about hope. &#34;Lance Secretan applies principles of higher consciousness to the business world. He is a &#34;corporate missionary&#34; who not only convinces us of the need to bring soul in to the workplace, but shows us how to do it. This book is extremely valuable.&#34;-Marianne Williamson, author of A Return to Love. &#34;Reclaiming Higher Ground is a must read. There is nothing more important today than creating organizations that inspire the soul. We have to get back in touch with who we are.&#34;-Ken Blanchard, co-author of The One-Minute Manager. &#34;An elixir for jaded executives and organizations recovering from reengineering, restructuring, and right-sizing.

Lewis (October 18, 1896 - January 15, 1971) was an American mystic and horticultural scientist who founded what became the Sufi Ruhaniat International, a branch of the Chishtia Sufi lineage. After a lifetime of spiritual study with teachers East and West, Lewis was recognized simultaneously as a Zen master and Sufi murshid (senior teacher) by Eastern representatives of the two traditions. He also co-founded the Christian mystical order called the The Holy Order of M.A.N.S. His early interest in international seed exchange and organic agriculture also established him as one of the pioneers of green spirituality. His most enduring legacy may be the creation of the Dances of Universal Peace, an early interspiritual practice that has spread around the world in the 43 years since his passing. <br> Neil Douglas-Klotz (editor) is the author of <i>Prayers of the Cosmos, Desert Wisdom, The Hidden Gospel</i> and <i>The Sufi Book of Life.</i> He was the archivist of Samuel L.

A wealth of biodiversity is found there, due to the close proximity of three major habitat types: the great western woodland grassy plains bump up against the inland edge of the coastal hinterland mountain forests, while the whole south-eastern Australian Alps system reaches its northern limit in the Brindabella Ranges. Each of these habitats has its own rich suite of plants and animals, so a great diversity of life can be found within an hour&#x2019;s drive of Parliament House. <br><br><i>A Bush Capital Year</i> introduces the fauna, flora, habitats and reserves of the Australian Capital Territory and includes the most recent research available. It also emphasizes often unappreciated or even unrecognized urban wildlife. <br><br>For each month of the year there are 10 stories which discuss either a species or a group of species, such as mosses and mountain grasshoppers. While never anthropomorphic, many of the stories are written from the organism&#x2019;s point of view, while others are from that of an observer. Beautiful paintings complement the text and allow better visualization of the stories and the subjects.</p><p>Ian Fraser&nbsp;is a naturalist, conservationist, author, ABC broadcaster, natural history tour guide, environmental consultant and adult educator, who has lived and worked in Canberra since 1980.

For each month, 10 brief stories give insight on various species of the region's three major habitat types: woodland grassy plains, coastland mountain forests, and alpine environment.

The Blue Riband of flying in the British Isles between the two World Wars was the King&#39;s Cup: Henshaw set his heart on it, developing a technique of racing which extracted the very maximum from his aircraft: firs the Comper Swift and then the DH Leopard Moth. Parallel with his search for speed was an obsession with making accurate landfalls, and he developed this blind-flying taken deliberately in a flying partnership with his father on many carefully planned long-distance survery flights. His exciting apprenticeship in these two skills was crowned by the acquisition of the Percival Mew Gull G-AEXF in 1937. His amazing solo flight to Cape Town and back in February 1939 established several solo records that still stand today, almost 60 years later. This feat of navigation and airmanship must surely be one of man&#39;s greatest flights - 12,754 miles over desert, sea and jungle in a single-engined light aircraft.</p><p>Awarded Siddeley Trophy 1933.

Her belief that children have the capacity-indeed a talent-for meditative prayer led her to create scripturally based meditations for them. Sister Jane specialized in adapting the Ignatian form of meditation to meet the needs of children. She invited them to use their five senses to envision a scriptural scene as a backdrop for meeting the Lord. A seasoned speaker, Jane also conducted workshops for parents and teachers to teach children how to pray. Her book is an extension of her e orts to help busy adults meet the prayer needs of their children. Guided Meditations for Children provides not only clear direction for those who lead young persons in prayer; but also lays the foundation for enriching life-long reflection for all God&#39;s children, young and old alike. Through her life and her writings, Jane taught many how to hear the &#34;tiny whispering sound&#34; of God as Elijah did on the mountain. Jane died in November 2013. In her autobiography, she had written: &#34;I was moved, drawn to this life [as a BVM sister] led by the Spirit. The most rewarding [part] about this life is living with Sisters who have the same cause, deepening our relationship with God and reaching out to others&#34;</p><h2>The Five Elements of Self-Healing: Using Chinese Medicine for Maximum Immunity, Wellness, and Health</h2><p><b>The Five Elements of Self-Healing</b> grows out of herbalist and acupuncturist Jason Elias's conviction that the nature of the illnesses that he has encountered in his patients has changed dramatically since he started practicing complementary medicine twenty-five years ago. Every week he sees patients with disorders that were much less common fifteen or twenty years ago: chronic allergies, adult-onset diabetes, eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, environmental illness, irritable bowel syndrome, lupus, and many different kinds of cancer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Reflecting on the health crises now facing us and on the connection between the rise in chronic immune disorders and toxic environmental and lifestyle patterns, Elias and collaborator Katherine Ketcham looked to the 5,000-year-old account of Chinese medicine, The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine, to seek the clues for restoring the balance of body and mind and finding the pathway to health and harmony. The result is <b>The Five Elements of Self-Healing</b>, which shows readers how to use the preventive strategies and gentle, supportive remedies of traditional Chinese medicine to heal contemporary chronic illnesses and bolster immunity, wellness, and mind-body harmony.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The Five Elements of Self-Healing</b> explores the Five Element System, the unique classification and diagnostic system that is the basis of traditional Chinese medicine. The first part of the book teaches readers how to identify which of the five elements--Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water--most directly influences their physical, emotional, and spiritual beings, and which imbalances in these energies can lead to particular physical, emotional, and spiritual disorders. The authors give detailed suggestions for restoring mind-body harmony and maintaining immunity and wellness, including stress- reduction techniques, dietary and exercise regimens, and the use of Chinese and Western herbs, nutritional supplements, and acupressure. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In the second part of the book, the authors outline the causes, symptoms, and treatments of the most common immune system disorders, from the relatively benign colds and flus to the more chronic and distressing problems of allergies, asthma, and chronic fatigue syndrome and the life-threatening diseases of diabetes and cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>With step-by-step instructions for self-treatment, inspiring case studies of Elias's patients' recoveries, and engaging stories from diverse folk traditions, <b>The Five Elements of Self-Healing</b> creates a system of medicine that honors the whole person: body and mind and spirit. Shining the light of ancient wisdom into the shadows of modern disease, this book guides readers toward a broader understanding of the art of self-healing.</p><p>Praise for THE FIVE ELEMENTS OF SELF-HEALING<br><br>"A valuable guide to integrating the best of both Western and Oriental medicine, written by a rarity--a healer knowledgeable in both."<br>--Peter D'Adamo, B.Sc.N.D., author of Eat Right 4 Your Type<br><br>"Jason Elias and Katherine Ketcham have written a wonderfully lucid presentation on how Chinese medicine can affect your health.

She lives in New Hampshire with her husband and three children. Visit her website at www.jodipicoult.com.<b>Chapter One: Anna</b><p>When I was little, the great mystery to me wasn't <i>how</i> babies were made, but <i>why</i>. The mechanics I understood -- my older brother Jesse had filled me in -- although at the time I was sure he'd heard half of it wrong. Other kids my age were busy looking up the words <i>penis</i> and <i>vagina</i> in the classroom dictionary when the teacher had her back turned, but I paid attention to different details. Like why some mothers only had one child, while other families seemed to multiply before your eyes. Or how the new girl in school, Sedona, told anyone who'd listen that she was named for the place where her parents were vacationing when they made her (<i>"Good thing they weren't staying in Jersey City,"</i> my father used to say). </p><p>Now that I am thirteen, these distinctions are only more complicated: the eighth-grader who dropped out of school because she <i>got into trouble;</i> a neighbor who <i>got herself pregnant</i> in the hopes it would keep her husband from filing for divorce. I'm telling you, if aliens landed on earth today and took a good hard look at why babies get born, they'd conclude that most people have children by accident, or because they drink too much on a certain night, or because birth control isn't one hundred percent, or for a thousand other reasons that really aren't very flattering.</p><p>On the other hand, I was born for a very specific purpose. I wasn't the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment. I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs and my father's sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material. In fact, when Jesse told me how babies get made and I, the great disbeliever, decided to ask my parents the truth, I got more than I bargained for. They sat me down and told me all the usual stuff, of course -- but they also explained that they chose little embryonic me, specifically, because I could save my sister, Kate. "We loved you even more," my mother made sure to say, "because we knew what exactly we were getting."</p><p>It made me wonder, though, what would have happened if Kate had been healthy. Chances are, I'd still be floating up in Heaven or wherever, waiting to be attached to a body to spend some time on Earth. Certainly I would not be part of this family. See, unlike the rest of the free world, I didn't get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it's gone, so are you.</p><p>Pawnshops may be full of junk, but they're also a breeding ground for stories, if you ask me, not that you did. What happened to make a person trade in the Never Before Worn Diamond Solitaire? Who needed money so badly they'd sell a teddy bear missing an eye? As I walk up to the counter, I wonder if someone will look at the locket I'm about to give up, and ask these same questions. </p><p>The man at the cash register has a nose the shape of a turnip, and eyes sunk so deep I can't imagine how he sees well enough to go about his business. "Need something?" he asks. </p><p>It's all I can do to not turn around and walk out the door, pretend I've come in by mistake. The only thing that keeps me steady is knowing I am not the first person to stand in front of this counter holding the one item in the world I never thought I'd part with.</p><p>"I have something to sell," I tell him.</p><p>"Am I supposed to guess what it is?"</p><p>"Oh." Swallowing, I pull the locket out of the pocket of my jeans. The heart falls on the glass counter in a pool of its own chain. "It's </p><p>fourteen-karat gold," I pitch. "Hardly ever worn." This is a lie; until this morning, I haven't taken it off in seven years. My father gave it to me when I was six after the bone marrow harvest, because he said anyone who was giving her sister such a major present deserved one of her own. Seeing it there, on the counter, my neck feels shivery and naked.</p><p>The owner puts a loop up to his eye, which makes it seem almost normal size. "I'll give you twenty."</p><p><i>"Dollars?"</i></p><p>"No, pesos. What did you think?"</p><p>"It's worth five times that!" I'm guessing.</p><p>The owner shrugs. "I'm not the one who needs the money."</p><p>I pick up the locket, resigned to sealing the deal, and the strangest thing happens -- my hand, it just clamps shut like the Jaws of Life. My face goes red with the effort to peel apart my fingers. It takes what seems like an hour for that locket to spill into the owner's outstretched palm. His eyes stay on my face, softer now. "Tell them you lost it," he offers, advice tossed in for free.</p><p>If Mr. Webster had decided to put the word <i>freak</i> in his dictionary, <i>Anna Fitzgerald</i> would be the best definition he could give. It's more than just the way I look: refugee-skinny with absolutely no chest to speak of, hair the color of dirt, connect-the-dot freckles on my cheeks that, let me tell you, do not fade with lemon juice or sunscreen or even, sadly, sandpaper. No, God was obviously in some kind of mood on my birthday, because he added to this fabulous physical combination the bigger picture -- the household into which I was born. </p><p>My parents tried to make things normal, but that's a relative term. The truth is, I was never really a kid. To be honest, neither were Kate and Jesse. I guess maybe my brother had his moment in the sun for the four years he was alive before Kate got diagnosed, but ever since then, we've been too busy looking over our shoulders to run headlong into growing up. You know how most little kids think they're like cartoon characters -- if an anvil drops on their heads they can peel themselves off the sidewalk and keep going? Well, I never once believed that. How could I, when we practically set a place for Death at the dinner table? </p><p>Kate has acute promyelocytic leukemia. Actually, that's not quite true -- right now she doesn't have it, but it's hibernating under her skin like a bear, until it decides to roar again. She was diagnosed when she was two; she's sixteen now. <i>Molecular relapse</i> and <i>granulocyte</i> and <i>portacath</i> -- these words are part of my vocabulary, even though I'll never find them on any SAT. I'm an allogeneic donor -- a perfect sibling match. When Kate needs leukocytes or stem cells or bone marrow to fool her body into thinking it's healthy, I'm the one who provides them. Nearly every time Kate's hospitalized, I wind up there, too.</p><p>None of which means anything, except that you shouldn't believe what you hear about me, least of all that which I tell you myself. </p><p>As I am coming up the stairs, my mother comes out of her room wearing another ball gown. "Ah," she says, turning her back to me. "Just the girl I wanted to see."</p><p>I zip it up and watch her twirl. My mother could be beautiful, if she were parachuted into someone else's life. She has long dark hair and the fine collarbones of a princess, but the corners of her mouth turn down, like she's swallowed bitter news. She doesn't have much free time, since a calendar is something that can change drastically if my sister develops a bruise or a nosebleed, but what she does have she spends at Bluefly.com, ordering ridiculously fancy evening dresses for places she is never going to go. "What do you think?" she asks.</p><p>The gown is all the colors of a sunset, and made out of material that swishes when she moves. It's strapless, what a star might wear sashaying down a red carpet -- totally not the dress code for a suburban house in Upper Darby, RI. My mother twists her hair into a knot and holds it in place. On her bed are three other dresses -- one slinky and black, one bugle-beaded, one that seems impossibly small. "You look..."</p><p><i>Tired</i>. The word bubbles right under my lips. </p><p>My mother goes perfectly still, and I wonder if I've said it without meaning to. She holds up a hand, shushing me, her ear cocked to the open doorway. "Did you hear that?"</p><p>"Hear what?"</p><p>"Kate."</p><p>"I didn't hear anything." </p><p>But she doesn't take my word for it, because when it comes to Kate she doesn't take anybody's word for it. She marches upstairs and opens up our bedroom door to find my sister hysterical on her bed, and just like that the world collapses again. My father, a closet astronomer, has tried to explain black holes to me, how they are so heavy they absorb everything, even light, right into their center. Moments like this are the same kind of vacuum; no matter what you cling to, you wind up being sucked in.</p><p>"Kate!" My mother sinks down to the floor, that stupid skirt a cloud around her. "Kate, honey, what hurts?"</p><p>Kate hugs a pillow to her stomach, and tears keep streaming down her face. Her pale hair is stuck to her face in damp streaks; her breathing's too tight. I stand frozen in the doorway of my own room, waiting for instructions: <i>Call Daddy. Call 911. Call Dr. Chance.</i> My mother goes so far as to shake a better explanation out of Kate. "It's Preston," she sobs. "He's leaving Serena for good."</p><p>That's when we notice the TV. On the screen, a blond hottie gives a longing look to a woman crying almost as hard as my sister, and then he slams the door. "But what hurts?" my mother asks, certain there has to be more to it than this.</p><p>"Oh my <i>God</i>," Kate says, sniffling. "Do you have any idea how much Serena and Preston have been through? Do you?"</p><p>That fist inside me relaxes, now that I know it's all right. Normal, in our house, is like a blanket too short for a bed -- sometimes it covers you just fine, and other times it leaves you cold and shaking; and worst of all, you never know which of the two it's going to be. I sit down on the end of Kate's bed. Although I'm only thirteen, I'm taller than her and every now and then people mistakenly assume I'm the older sister. At different times this summer she has been crazy for Callahan, Wyatt, and Liam, the male leads on this soap. Now, I guess, it's all about Preston. "There was the kidnapping scare," I volunteer. I actually followed that story line; Kate made me tape the show during her dialysis sessions. </p><p>"And the time she almost married his twin by mistake," Kate adds. </p><p>"Don't forget when he died in the boat accident.

Henci Goer, author of The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth and Obstetric Myths Versus Research Realities <p>Paulina Perez has worked miracles once again. In this second edition, she gives the reader the tools to bring the "soul of birth" back to women. At this time in history with the increase in cesareans on demand and birth by technology, there is an urgent need to listen to this wise woman and follow her lead. Celeste Phillips, RN, EdD, author of Family-Centered Maternity Care </p><p>Since the first edition was published in 1997, thousands of to-be mothers, nurses, doulas and other health care professionals have turned to this book for information and how-to instructions. It serves as a guide and inspiration to those experiencing childbirth and to those assisting with the experience. Childbirth can be and should be the most powerful and inspiring life event for everyone involved. The first edition was a must-read, but this second edition is must-HAVE book. Bev Deaton, 2005 President of AWHONN </p><p>The Nurturing Touch is not only a resource book, it is a wake up call for those of us delivering care to women. We have normalized deviance in perinatal care to the point that routine elective cesarean on demand is readily accepted, nurses have diminished skills with actual hands on care, and we devote our energy to the care of technology. We must stop the craziness and return control of the birth experience to the woman and her family and change birth from the medicalized model we have created back to the normal process that we know it should be.

It covers the period from the Russian elections of December 2003 to the tragic aftermath of the Beslan school siege in late 2005. The book is an unflinching record of the plight of millions of Russians and a pitiless report on the cynicism and corruption of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s presidency.<br><br>She interviews people whose lives have been devastated by Putin&#x2019;s policies, including the mothers of children who died in the Beslan siege, those of Russian soldiers maimed in Chechnya then abandoned by the State, and of &#x201c;disappeared&#x201d; young men and women.

She also criticizes the inability of liberals and democrats to provide a united, effective opposition and a population slow to protest against government legislative outrages.<br><br><b>A Russian Diary</b> is clear-sighted, passionate and marked with the humanity that made Anna Politkovskaya known to many as &#x201c;Russia&#x2019;s lost moral conscience&#x201d; and a heroine to readers throughout the world.</p><p>Anna Politkovskaya was a special correspondent for the Russian newspaper <i>Novaya Gazeta</i> and the recipient of many honours for her writing.PART ONE <br> <br>The Death of Russian Parliamentary Democracy <br> <br>December 2003&#x2013;March 2004 <br> <br>How Did Putin Get ReElected? <br> <br>According to the census of october 2002, there are 145.2 million people living in Russia, making us the seventh most populous country in the world. Just under 116 million people, 79.8 percent of the population, describe themselves as ethnically Russian. We have an electorate of 109 million voters. <br> <br>December 7, 2003 <br> <br>The day of the parliamentary elections to the Duma,* the day Putin* began his campaign for reelection as president. In the morning he manifested himself to the peoples of Russia at a polling station. He was cheerful, elated even, and a little nervous. This was unusual: as a rule he is sullen. With a broad smile, he informed those assembled that his beloved Labrador, Connie, had had puppies during the night. &#x201c;Vladimir Vladimirovich was so very worried,&#x201d; Madame Putina intoned from behind her husband. &#x201c;We are in a hurry to get home,&#x201d; she added, anxious to return to the bitch whose impeccable political timing had presented this gift to the United Russia Party.* <br> <br>That same morning in Yessentuki, a small resort in the North Caucasus, the first thirteen victims of a terrorist attack on a local train were being buried. It had been the morning train, known as the student train, and young people were on their way to college. <br> <br>When, after voting, Putin went over to the journalists, it seemed he would surely express his condolences to the families of the dead. Perhaps even apologize for the fact that the government had once again failed to protect its citizens. Instead he told them how pleased he was about his Labrador&#x2019;s new puppies. <br> <br>My friends phoned me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s really put his foot in it this time. Rus- sian people are never going to vote for United Russia now.&#x201d; <br> <br>Around midnight, however, when the results started coming in, initially from the Far East, then from Siberia, the Urals, and so on westward, many people were in a state of shock. All my pro-democracy friends and acquaintances were again calling each other and saying, &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be true. We voted for Yavlinsky,* even though. . . .&#x201d; Some had voted for Khakamada.* <br> <br>By morning there was no more incredulity. Russia, rejecting the lies and arrogance of the democrats, had mutely surrendered herself to Putin. A majority had voted for the phantom United Russia Party, whose sole political program was to support Putin. United Russia had rallied Russia&#x2019;s bureaucrats to its banner&#x2014;all the former Soviet Communist Party and Young Communist League functionaries now employed by myriad government agencies&#x2014;and they had jointly allocated huge sums of money to promote its electoral deceptions. <br> <br>Reports we received from the regions show how this was done. Outside one of the polling stations in Saratov, a lady was dispensing free vodka at a table with a banner reading &#x201c;Vote for Tretiak,&#x201d; the United Russia candidate. Tretiak won. The Duma deputies from the entire province were swept away by United Russia candidates, except for a few who switched to the party shortly before the elections. The Saratov election campaign was marked by violence, with candidates not approved of by United Russia being beaten up by &#x201c;unidentified assailants&#x201d; and choosing to pull out of the race. One who continued to campaign against a prominent United Russia candidate twice had plastic bags containing body parts thrown through his window: somebody&#x2019;s ears and a human heart. The province&#x2019;s electoral commission had a hotline to take reports of irregularities during the campaign and the voting, but 80 percent of the calls were simply attempts to blackmail the local utility companies. People threatened not to vote unless their leaking pipes were mended or their radiators repaired. This worked very well. The inhabitants of the Zavod and Lenin districts had their heating and main water supply restored. A number of villages in the Atkar District finally had their electricity and telephones reconnected after several years of waiting. The people were seduced. More than 60 percent of the electorate in the city voted, and in the province the turnout was 53 percent. More than enough for the elections to be valid. <br> <br>One of the democrats&#x2019; observers at a polling station in Arkadak noticed people voting twice, once in the booth and a second time by filling out a ballot slip under the direction of the chairman of the local electoral commission. She ran to phone the hotline, but was pulled away from the telephone by her hair. <br> <br>Vyacheslav Volodin, one of the main United Russia functionaries who was standing in Balakov, won by a landslide, with 82.9 percent of the vote; an unprecedented victory for a politician devoid of charisma who is renowned only for his incoherent television speeches in support of Putin. He had announced no specific policies to promote the inter- ests of local people. Overall in Saratov Province, United Russia gained 48.2 percent of the vote without feeling the need to publish or defend a manifesto. The Communists got 15.7 percent, the Liberal Democrats* (Vladimir Zhirinovsky&#x2019;s* party) 8.9 percent, the nationalistic Rodina (Motherland) Party* 5.7 percent. The only embarrassment was that more than 10 percent of the votes cast were for &#x201c;None of the above.&#x201d; One-tenth of the voters had come to the polling station, drunk the vodka, and told the lot of them to go to hell. <br> <br>According to the National Electoral Commission&#x2019;s figures, over 10 percent more votes were cast in Chechnya,* a territory totally under military control, than there are registered voters. <br> <br>St. Petersburg held on to its reputation as Russia&#x2019;s most progressive and democratically inclined city. Even there, though, United Russia gained 31 percent of the vote, Rodina about 14 percent. The democratic Union of Right Forces* and Yabloko* (Apple) Party got only 9 percent each, the Communists 8.5, and the Liberal Democrats 8 percent. Irina Khakamada, Alexander Golov, Igor Artemiev, and Grigorii Tomchin, democrats and liberals well known throughout Russia, went down to ignominious defeat. <br> <br>Why? The state authorities are rubbing their hands with glee, tut- tutting and saying that &#x201c;the democrats have only themselves to blame&#x201d; for having lost their link with the people. The authorities suppose that, on the contrary, they now have the people on their side. <br> <br>Here are some excerpts from essays written by St. Petersburg students on the topics of &#x201c;How my family views the elections&#x201d; and &#x201c;Will the election of a new Duma help the president in his work?&#x201d;: <br> <br>&#x201c;My family has given up voting. They don&#x2019;t believe in elections anymore. The elections will not help the president. All the politicians promise to make life better, but unfortunately . . . I would like more truthfulness.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;The elections are rubbish. It doesn&#x2019;t matter who gets elected to the Duma because nothing will change, because we don&#x2019;t elect people who are going to improve things in the country, but people who thieve. These elections will help no one&#x2014;neither the president nor ordinary mortals.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Our government is just ridiculous. I wish people weren&#x2019;t so crazy about money, that there was at least some sign of moral principle in our government, and that they would cheat the people as little as possible. The government is the servant of the people. We elect it, not the other way round. To tell the truth, I don&#x2019;t know why we have been asked to write this essay. It has only interrupted our lessons. The government isn&#x2019;t going to read this anyway.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;How my family views the elections is they aren&#x2019;t interested in them. All the laws the Duma adopted were senseless and did nothing useful for the people. If all this is not for the people, who is it for?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Will the elections help? It is an interesting question. We will have to wait and see. Most likely they won&#x2019;t help in the slightest. I am not a politician, I don&#x2019;t have the education you need for that, but the main thing is that we need to fight corruption. For as long as we have gangsters in the state institutions of our country, life will not get better. Do you know what is going on now in the army? It is just endless bullying. If in the past people used to say that the army made boys into men, now it makes them into cripples. My father says he refuses to let his son go into an army like that. &#x2018;For my son to be a cripple after the army, or even worse&#x2014;to be dead in a ditch somewhere in Chechnya, fighting for who knows what, so that somebody can gain power over this republic?&#x2019; For as long as the present government is in power I can see no way out of the present situation. I do not thank it for my unhappy childhood.&#x201d; <br> <br>These read like the thoughts of old people, not the future citizens of New Russia. Here is the real cost of political cynicism&#x2014;rejection by the younger generation. <br> <br>December 8 <br> <br>By morning it is finally clear that, while the left wing has more or less survived, the liberal and democratic &#x201c;right wing&#x201d; has been routed. The Yabloko Party and Grigorii Yavlinsky himself have not made it into the Duma, neither has the Union of Right Forces with Boris Nemtsov and Irina Khakamada, nor any of the independent candidates. There is now almost nobody in the Russian Parliament capable of lobbying for democratic ideals and providing constructive, intelligent opposition to the Kremlin. The triumph of the United Russia Party is not the worst of it, however. <br> <br>By the end of the day, with more or less all the votes counted, it is evident that, for the first time since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has particularly favored the extreme nationalists, who promised the voters they would hang all the &#x201c;enemies of Russia.&#x201d; <br> <br>This is dreadful, of course, but perhaps only to be ...</p><h2>Tooth And Nail</h2><p>They call him the Wolfman - because he takes a bite out of his victims and because they found the first victim in the East End&#39;s lonely Wolf Street. Scotland Yard are anxious to find the killer and Inspector Rebus is drafted in to help, thanks to his supposed expertise in the modus operandi of serial killers. But his Scotland Yard opposite number, George Flight, isn&#39;t happy at yet more interference - it&#39;s bad enough having several Chief Inspectors on your back - and Rebus finds himself dealing with racial prejudice as well as the predations of a violent maniac. When Rebus is offered a serial killer profile of the Wolfman by an attractive female psychologist, it&#39;s too good an opportunity to miss.

A Swiss expatriate who attempted to create a personal empire in California&#x2019;s Sacramento Valley, he founded New Helvetia, a cosmopolitan settlement whose economy depended on Indian slaves and free laborers. New Helvetia drew overland immigrants to California in the 1840s and then&#x2015;after gold was discovered by Sutter&#x2019;s employees&#x2015;a flood of fortune seekers. Sutter was poised to become one of the richest men in the West, but rapacious settlers and his own poor business sense sent his dreams crashing.</p> <p>Albert L. Hurtado has written the definitive biography of Sutter, mining a wealth of sources to create the first fully documented account of the man and his times. <em>John Sutter</em> explores Sutter&#x2019;s life in the broader context of America&#x2019;s rush for westward expansion while plumbing the inner dynamics of this erstwhile empire-builder.</p> <p>Sutter was a quintessential outsider driven by anxiety over status&#x2015;a man of talent, vision, and heroic ambitions who nevertheless became the victim of his own inadequacies as a businessman and his inability to adjust to a rapidly changing frontier. Sutter was full of contradictions. While building a reputation as a humanitarian friend of destitute immigrants, he callously exploited Indians. Nevertheless, this penniless dreamer became one of the most important men in California and a major player in the American conquest of the West.</p></p><p><p><strong>Albert L. Hurtado</strong> is Professor and Paul H. and Doris Eaton Travis Chair of Modern American History at the University of Oklahoma. He is the author of several books, including <em>John Sutter: A Life on the North American Frontier</em>.&nbsp;</p>Hurtado, a historian at the University of Okla., captures the rise and fall of an important and colorful immigrant to 19th-century California. Swiss expat John Sutter (1803-1880) arrived there in 1839 and founded a settlement called New Helvetia on the Sacramento River. But his thriving agricultural and commercial endeavors were crippled by the Gold Rush, as many of his laborers quit and headed to the mines. The strength of this study is Hurtado's willingness to portray Sutter's faults: his reliance on cheap, even enslaved, Indian labor; his efforts, when California entered the Union, to prohibit Indian suffrage. And Hurtado captures Sutter's excesses: he was a lousy businessman who loved to spend rather than accumulate money, and he lived lavishly, purchasing "splendid clothes," portraits of himself, and other trappings of wealth and success. Yet Hurtado often misses opportunities to bring Sutter's story to life. The author's treatment of the destruction by arson of Hurtado's home, Hock Farm, in 1865 would have been vivid in the hands of a more artful writer, but Hurtado passes over the incident with a single paragraph. While this is likely to be the definitive scholarly biography of Sutter, it's too plodding to appeal to a broad audience. 21 b&amp;w illus., 3 maps. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why was it charming when she snorted from laughing too hard? Yes, we were jealous of her, and yet we did not hate her. She was never so much as teased by us, we roaming and bratty girls of Corona del Mar, thieves of corn nuts and orange soda, abusers of lip gloss and foul language.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> An astonishing debut about friendships made in youth, <i>The Girls from Corona del Mar </i>is a fiercely beautiful novel about how these bonds, challenged by loss, illness, parenthood, and distance, either break or endure.<br><br> Mia and Lorrie Ann are lifelong friends: hard-hearted Mia and untouchably beautiful, kind Lorrie Ann. While Mia struggles with a mother who drinks, a pregnancy at fifteen, and younger brothers she loves but can&#x2019;t quite be good to, Lorrie Ann is luminous, surrounded by her close-knit family, immune to the mistakes that mar her best friend&#x2019;s life. Then a sudden loss catapults Lorrie Ann into tragedy: things fall apart, and then fall further&#x2014;and there is nothing Mia can do to help. And as good, brave, fair Lorrie Ann stops being so good, Mia begins to question just who this woman is, and what that question means about them both. <br><br> A staggeringly honest, deeply felt novel of family, motherhood, loyalty, and the myth of the perfect friendship, <i>The Girls from Corona del Mar</i> asks just how well we know those we love, what we owe our children, and who we are without our friends.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2014:</strong> While much of pop culture might have you believe otherwise, the most important relationship a young woman has is not always with her first love, or even, say, with her father. It is with her best friend, the one to whom she tells everything about her sexual encounters, the one who accompanies her to medical procedures, the one who sometimes forgives but never forgets. As Rufi Thorpe demonstrates so vividly in her debut <em>The Girls from Corona del Mar</em>, the one we grow up with is the one we love forever--even well after we&#x2019;ve grown apart. Lorrie Ann seems perfect: gorgeous, smart, and charming, while her best friend Mia, while brainy and attractive, has a more deliberative personality, and an alcoholic parent, to boot. If biology were destiny, it would be Lorrie Ann who succeeded most in life--except that bad choices and bad breaks intervened. Over nearly two decades, we watch Mia try to come to terms with her friend&#x2019;s struggles and to understand why things didn&#x2019;t go as planned. Occasionally, graduate-student Mia feels pretentious--her obsession with her PhD project, ancient Babylonian myth, is grating--and the way Lorrie Ann&#x2019;s life unfolds can be contrived. But because of Thorpe&#x2019;s raw and intelligent voice, this book stays with you. Mia calls her time in school &#x201c;those seven strenuous years of tugging myself slowly toward excellence,&#x201d; and explains Lorrie Ann&#x2019;s attraction to an inappropriate mate this way: &#x201c;She wanted to pick him up and shake him up and down until all the amazing things inside of him came out . . .[like]. . . the fallen candy from a pi�ata.&#x201d; You may not like either of these women all the time, but you&#x2019;ll likely recognize them, and find it hard to turn away. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>RUFI THORPE received her MFA from the University of Virginia in 2009.

However, for a concise but authoritative summary of the design history and careers of the major surface ships it is difficult to beat a series of six volumes written by Gerhard Koop and illustrated by Klaus-Peter Schmolke. Each contains an account of the development of a particular class, a detailed description of the ships, with full technical details, and an outline of their service, heavily illustrated with plans, battle maps and a substantial collection of photographs. These have been out of print for ten years or more and are now much sought after by enthusiasts and collectors, so this new modestly priced reprint of the series will be widely welcomed. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the subject of this volume, were the product of a long, involved and politically determined design process that saw them develop from an improved Pocket Battleship to what many described as a battlecruiser, although they were really fast battleships. They were the most active, and successful, of the Kriegesmarine&#39;s major warships, taking part in numerous famous operations, including the infamous &#39;Channel Dash&#39;.</p><p>Gerhard Koop served in both the Kriegesmarine and the postwar Bundesmarine, and became one of German&#39;s leading authorities on warship design and the author of numerous highly regarded books.

Butler's administration in New Orleans during the second year of the Civil War. Some historians have extolled the general as a great humanitarian, while others have vilified him as a brazen opportunist, agreeing with the wealthy of occupied New Orleans who labeled him "Beast" Butler. In this thorough examination of Butler's career in the Crescent City, Chester G. Hearn reveals that both assessments are right.<br>As a criminal lawyer prior to entering politics, Butler learned two great lessons -- how to beat the rich and powerful at their own game, and how to succeed as a felon without being caught. In New Orleans, Butler drew on these lessons, visibly enjoying power, removing those who questioned his authority, and delighting in defeating his opponents. Because of his remoteness from Washington, he was able to make up his own rules as he went along, surrounding himself with trusted friends and family members who had no choice but to keep his secrets lest they incriminate themselves.<br>Butler made every effort to humble the rich, who abhorred him and whose sordid characterizations of his regime -- some true, some not -- became legendary. As Hearn explains, Butler's legacy of corruption clouded many admirable aspects of his administration. He championed the poor, many of whom would have starved had he not fed and employed them.

He finally has a skilled one in Chester G. Hearn, author of <i>The Capture of New Orleans, 1862</i>. Butler headed the federal occupation of New Orleans, where he quickly imposed order on a rebellious city. He also made out like a bandit, diverting an enormous amount of money into his personal coffers. High society scorned him for his infamous "Woman Order," in which he castigated the "women (calling themselves ladies) of New Orleans" for rudeness toward his troops. An international furor erupted over this purported slight to southern womanhood, but history has always appreciated its comic element. "Butler--no matter where he was or what he did--attracted trouble," writes Hearn, who has given us a good rendering of an unforgettable man.<p>Chester G. Hearn is the author of many books on the Civil War, including Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War; Companions in Conspiracy: John Brown and Gerrit Smith; and The Capture of New Orleans, 1862.

It is crucial for those considering divorce to anticipate what lies ahead in order to make informed decisions. Too often the fallout from divorce is far more devastating than many people realize when contemplating the move. This chapter outlines some of the common pitfalls of divorce to aid readers in decisions about their marriages.<br><br>The following is a letter written by a woman who read an article about my views on divorce in the <i>Los Angeles Times:</i><br><br>Dear Ms. Weiner-Davis:<br><br>My age is sixty-seven, and after nineteen years of a marriage that was impossible in my opinion, I did seek a divorce. I sincerely believed that my children and I would be better off if I got out of the marriage, and this was confirmed and encouraged by therapists. I should have tried harder to make our lives better. I should have changed myself more. I wish I knew then all the things I know now. It takes so long to attain wisdom, when it is needed when one is young.<br><br>I was forty and attractive and wanted to "grow," and did not like the way my children were, emotionally, living with the type of person their father was. I did what I thought was the best thing to do, at that time. And yes, I did think I would spend a year or so alone, remarry, and everything would be fine.<br><br>My children, who did not like their father, were nevertheless adversely affected over the years because of the divorce. They are now grown and have learned to accept him as he is. But damage was done. I "went out into the world" for the first time in my life and I did grow, learn, experience fantastic fun and loneliness as well. I eventually remarried and my marriage at this time is fine. But it took a lot of work to make it this way.<br><br>The article stirred up lots of feelings and doubts about what I thought for so long was "the right thing" to do -- divorce. Many years ago, a friend said to me that getting a divorce is like getting hit by a Mack truck. It is. For everyone involved.<br><br>My ex-husband has remarried and I believe his wife has difficulty coping with some of his idiosyncrasies but she accepts them and enjoys an otherwise good life with him. (I should have been wise enough to do the same.)<br><br>I am not thoroughly convinced that I did the wrong thing, but I am sorry that I did not get better counseling and give it more time before disrupting four lives (two children). Maybe the marriage could have been saved.<br><br>Mainly, I would like to applaud you and the other therapists on the new view of divorce. Divorce should only be done as a last resort, when all other efforts have been exhausted. For everyone's sake.<br><br>You should feel proud of the work you are doing. Congratulations.<br><br>Mary<br><br>I was very touched by this letter because it captured the feelings expressed by so many divorced people I've met over the years. In a desperate attempt to expand her own life and improve the quality of life for her children, she left her husband. Convinced this move would be best for all concerned, she made a decision that would change their lives. As she reflected on the outcome of her decision, she was not without regrets. Her second marriage taught her that all marriages require a commitment to work out differences since no partners are perfect; like any package deal, there are pluses and minuses. With painstaking honesty, she admitted the wisdom in accepting certain idiosyncrasies in one's spouse in order to enjoy "an otherwise good life with him" (as his new wife understands).<br><br>Her children taught her about the damaging effects of divorce despite her belief she was rescuing them from their unlikable father. Ironically, they eventually learned to "accept him as he is" anyway. Despite her personal gains from the divorce, she regretted not having given the marriage more time and gotten more support for staying married from the therapists she encountered along the way.<br><br><b>ARE WE FINALLY LEARNING?</b><br><br>Clearly, divorce supplied no magic solutions for Mary. It appears that more and more couples are beginning to take a skeptical view of divorce. In fact, something remarkable happened in 1982: For the first time in twenty-five years the divorce rate dropped, after having first leveled off for one year. The National Center for Health Statistics indicated that the 1989 rates were down 4 percent from 1988. This decline followed an unprecedented rise in the number of divorces in our country from 1960 through 1980.<br><br>Why the decrease; what's going on? There are many theories. Some say the growing threat of AIDS is keeping couples together or that more couples are separating but not divorcing to spare themselves legal costs. However, my explanation is different. I believe that people are beginning to realize how devastating divorce is -- emotionally, financially and spiritually -- for everyone involved. With enough time under our belts to have observed the results of rampant divorce, we are beginning to recognize the price we have paid for the freedom of disposable marriages.<br><br>My conclusion -- that divorce is not the answer -- is based on more than a decade of observation of clients, friends and family who have opted to divorce and on input from many of my colleagues who work with couples and families. In regard to divorce, this is what I have learned:<br><br><b>1. DIVORCE DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IT IS MEANT TO SOLVE</b><br><br>There are primarily two reasons people divorce. One is to escape a relationship that has been painful, loveless or destructive. The second is to seek a more satisfying life with a new partner or alone. As you will see in this chapter, these goals are not always accomplished through divorce. Some people do go on to enhance their lives, but the price they pay is often higher than anticipated.<br><br>Few adults anticipate accurately what lies ahead when they decide to divorce. Life is almost always more arduous and more complicated than they expect. It is often more depleting and more lonely for at least one member of the marriage. At the time of divorce, people are intent on getting rid of their unhappiness, and they find it difficult to conjure up understanding for something they have never experienced. It is hard for them to imagine the multiple changes that divorce will bring in its wake. Eventually they do learn, however, that the changes we make from divorce are hard-won. (Wallerstein and Blakeslee, 1989.)<br><br><b>"If It Weren't for You, I'd Be Happy"</b><br><br>Desperately unhappy people search for ways out of their unhappiness. They start by trying to determine the cause of their misery. As they look around, married people often see their spouse as the culprit. Blaming your spouse for your unhappiness is easy to do. Everyone does it, often supported in this kind of thinking by friends and relatives. "I would be happier if he were more attentive"; "If she didn't nag so much, I would enjoy my life"; "He's gone so much, of course I'm miserable" are some of the more common spousal complaints. Underlying each of these statements is the belief that the person's unhappiness is caused by his or her mate. Logic then dictates that divorce is the solution: "If I get rid of my spouse, I will get rid of this problem and then I will be happy."<br><br>Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. People are shocked to discover that their difficulties continue to hound them in spite of their single status or their choice of a new partner. Some disillusioned divorced people tell me, "My spouse's habits really irritated me, but now I can't cope with this loneliness. The silence in the evenings is killing me." Or "The new guy I married seemed so sensitive and open, the qualifies I missed in my first marriage, but as I've gotten to know him better he now seems more like a clone of my first husband." Or "I thought leaving my wife and all of her demands would make me happy, but oddly enough I am still unhappy."<br><br>As you will learn from this book, diagnosing your spouse as the problem means that your microscope lens may be too narrowly focused. You are failing to notice how the habits you <i>both</i> have developed and the roles you've <i>both</i> played have contributed to your unworkable marriage. Unfortunately, you take those habits with you when you go.<br><br>If getting rid of one's problematic spouse was a solution, why would 60 percent of second marriages end in divorce? If divorce were truly an answer, people would learn from the mistakes they made in their first marriage. Their second marriage would provide them with opportunities to apply what they learned. Sometimes this is the case, but more frequently, people are not prepared for the complexities of second marriages or blended families. Sometimes the trials and tribulations of the previous marriage with all its aggravation seem mild by comparison. But the results of this sort of comparison come too late. People discover that the grass isn't any greener on the other side after all. Then the decision to divorce a second time is often less agonizing since there's familiarity with the process.<br><br><b>"If It Weren't for You, There Would Be No More Arguments"</b><br><br>Many people leave their marriages expecting the arguments to stop. Divorce does offer a temporary reprieve from the tension and/or arguing, but when children are involved, marital debates frequently <i>do not</i> cease with the divorce decree. I have worked with divorced couples unable to resolve child-custody, visitation and child-rearing issues. They give new meaning to the words "hostile" and "angry." That these two human beings once shared a cordial or loving relationship is almost unthinkable because all that remains of their shared history is hatred.<br><br>What also continues to amaze me is how even many years of physical separation fail to free these couples from intense emotional bonds. Their inability to resolve certain child-rearing issues reflects their inability to let go of each other.<br><br>Debra and Thomas, a divorced couple, arrived in my office for divorce mediation since they were unable to resolve major disagreements over the visitation schedule. Like many couples needing mediation, Debra and Thomas's interactions were characterized by animosity and lack of respect. Even when addressing each other, they maintained eye contact with me. They frequently interrupted each other with accusations or alternative versions of the truth. When I requested that each person be allowed to speak uninterrupted, "loud" grimaces took the place of verbal attacks.<br><br>Although I kept them focused on the task at hand, finding solutions to the visitation problems, eventually the conversation turned to the disappointment they felt about unmet needs in the marriage. Debra wept as she told of her close relationship with her father and how Thomas failed to live up to the memories she had of her childhood with her dad. Thomas felt that Debra never really respected him due to their cultural and socioeconomic differences. He thought he was never good enough in the eyes of Debra's family. The sadness of their failed relationship was fresh for both of them though they had been divorced for five years.<br><br>What upset Debra the most was that, since the time of their divorce and Thomas's subsequent marriage to Sue, Thomas was taking a more active parenting role. Now each time Thomas sought more contact with the children, instead of feeling pleased for the children that they were important to their dad, she felt betrayed and manipulated. "Why, if the children are so important to you, didn't you make time for them when we were married?" she challenged him. His requests for increased visitation were often denied because of her resentment over thwarted dreams.<br><br>Thomas never took Debra's criticism about his priorities seriously when they were married because, according to him, Debra criticized him about everything. Debra's pleas for more involvement with the children were seen as just one more item on Debra's long laundry list of Thomas's inadequacies. So Thomas had resisted more involvement with the children, not because he didn't love them or want to be with them, but because of the tug-of-war with Debra. Once separated from her, he missed the children and saw that his relationship with them was important to him. This explained his recent desire to spend more time with them.<br><br>Although an agreement about visitation was reached during that session, Debra left crying. I believe she cried all the way home. Thomas also showed signs of feeling drained emotionally. They both had hoped that their divorce would free them from disappointment, arguments about the children and criticisms of each other, none of which happened. Clearly, their unresolved relationship issues kept them super-glued to each other, making it impossible for them to cooperate as parents.<br><br>If you have children and are considering divorce, you must remember that your spouse will <i>always</i> be your children's parent, no matter what you do. Unless he or she decides to sever ties entirely, you will continue to have contact with that person for the rest of your life! This contact serves as a constant reminder of the past. Children can also be ghosts of failed marriages when, because of their looks or personalities, they remind a parent of an estranged spouse. This can have deadly consequences for the parent-child relationship.<br><br><b>2. DIVORCE CREATES NEW PROBLEMS</b><br><br>When people divorce they have visions of better lives. Old problems will vanish, they hope, as new dreams take their place. These dreams usually include meeting candidates for more intimate relationships, more compatible sexual partners, improved financial status, more freedom to pursue personal goals and new opportunities to make independent choices. As explained above, these dreams frequently do not materialize, creating a whole new set of problems. Even when desired changes do occur, they are not without unintended or unexpected consequences. Let us take a look at some frequent but unexpected consequences of divorce.<br><br><b>Money Matters</b><br><br>If you are a woman, the statistics are bleak. Lenore Weitzman, a sociologist who conducted an extensive study of divorced families, wrote in her book <i>The Divorce Revolution</i> that one year after divorce, women's standard of living decreases by 73 percent while men's increases by 42 percent. Furthermore, alimony is a thing of the past. Women seldom are awarded it. Weitzman writes:<br><br>These apparently simple statistics have far-reaching social and economic consequences. For most women and children, divorce means precipitous downward mobility -- both economically and socially. The reduction in income brings residential moves and inferior housing, drastically diminished or nonexistent funds for recreation and leisure, and intense pressures due to inadequate time and money. (Quoted in Berman, 1991, p. 57.)<br><br>Unfortunately, all too often, effects of changing financial status are overlooked, minimized or denied.<br><br><b>Where Is Mr. Right?</b><br><br>There are other disadvantages to being a newly divorced woman. According to the Census Bureau, divorced women are far less likely to remarry than divorced men. Forty percent of the women who divorce after age thirty do not remarry. A portion of those who do not remarry may do so by choice, but many say that the pool of marriage-minded men available to these women has been shrinking. It seems that many men in similar age brackets are marrying younger women.<br><br>Imagine how shocking it is to the woman who leaves a marriage hoping to find intimacy and romance in the perfect new mate and finds herself alone instea...</p><h2>Picasso: Creator and Destroyer</h2><p>Through numerous interviews with Picasso&#39;s intimates, the author penetrates the barriers of the Picasso myth to reveal the struggle between his power to create and his passion to destroy</p><p>ARIANNA STASSINOPOULOS HUFFINGTON is a writer, lecturer and broadcaster.

Wyden ( Bay of Pigs ), who fled Hitler's Germany in 1937 at the age of 13, was Stella's classmate in Berlin in a "non-Aryan" school they were forced to attend. In a gripping, extraordinary, deeply disturbing book, one of the most moving Holocaust documents, Wyden explains Goldschlag's unspeakable crimes in a psychically numbing way. Imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo, she went to work for them after being promised that her parents would be spared. (The Nazis lied; her parents were later shipped to Auschwitz.) In 1990 Wyden tracked down Stella in Germany. Unrepentant, loathing Jews, she considers herself an unjustly maligned victim, having spent 10 years in Soviet prison camps. Wyden also interviewed Stella's daughter, Yvonne Meissl, born in 1945, now a nurse in Israel, who has recurring fantasies of shooting Stella dead to expunge her memory forever. Photos.

He also worked for the US intelligence community throughout this period, passing back information about Lashkar&#x2019;s intentions for Mumbai.</p><p><b>Ajmal Kasab</b> &#x2013; born in 1987 to a poor family in the village of Faridkot in the eastern Punjab, Pakistan, Ajmal was one of ten young men recruited and trained by Lashkar-e-Toiba for the Mumbai attacks. He underwent religious instruction and nearly a year of physical training before being dispatched to India in November 2008.</p><p><b>Lashkar-e-Toiba</b> &#x2013; a Pakistani militia formed in 1990 to fight in Indian-administered Kashmir. The activities of Lashkar, which was funded and armed by Pakistan&#x2019;s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, were focused on sending highly trained <i>fidayeen</i> (guerrilla) units to fight Indian troops until the death.</p><p> <b>Hafiz Saeed</b> &#x2013; the <i>amir</i> (spiritual leader) of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the parent organization of Lashkar-e-Toiba. Born in the Punjab, Saeed, aged fifty-eight at the time of the Mumbai attacks, was an Islamic studies lecturer in Lahore until he travelled to Saudi Arabia during the eighties and began actively supporting the <i>mujahideen</i> fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. Soon after he returned to Pakistan he formed an Islamic movement underpinned by the Ahl-e-Hadith sect. It would lead to the establishment in 1990 of Lashkar-e-Toiba.</p><p><b>Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi</b> &#x2013; the <i>amir</i> and co-founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, <i>chacha</i> (uncle) Zaki, as he was known to all Lashkar recruits, was born in Okara, the same district of the eastern Punjab as Ajmal Kasab. During the eighties he abandoned his studies to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. He was Lashkar&#x2019;s chief military commander and was described by Indian investigators as the mastermind behind the Mumbai operation.</p><p></p><p>&#x2019;Mughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities<br>multiply me at once under your spell tonight.</p><p>He&#x2019;s freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.<br>He&#x2019;s left open &#x2013; for God &#x2013; the doors of Hell tonight.</p><p>In the heart&#x2019;s veined temple, all statues have been smashed.<br>No priest in saffron&#x2019;s left to toll its knell tonight.</p><p>God, limit these punishments, there&#x2019;s still Judgment Day &#x2013;<br>I&#x2019;m a mere sinner, I&#x2019;m no infidel tonight.&#x2019;</p><p>Agha Shahid Ali, &#x2018;Tonight&#x2019;, in <i>Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals</i><br>(W. W. Norton and Company Inc., 2003)</p><p></p><p> <i>Prologue</i></p><p><i>Wednesday, 26 November 2008, 8 p.m.</i></p><p>A sliver of moon hung over the Arabian Sea as the dinghy powered towards the &#x2018;Queen&#x2019;s Necklace&#x2019;, the chain of lights strung across Mumbai&#x2019;s Back Bay. The ten-man crew of Pakistani fighters rode the black waves in silence, listening to the thrum of the outboard motor and hunched over Chinese rucksacks, printed with English logos that read: &#x2018;Changing the Tide&#x2019;. Ten AK-47s, ten pistols, ammunition, grenades, explosives and timers, maps, water, almonds and raisins &#x2013; they laid out the contents in their minds. It barely seemed enough to take on the world&#x2019;s fourth-largest city. &#x2018;Surprise will get you in and fear will scatter the police,&#x2019; their instructors had assured them. They had practised night landings, and planting timed bombs in taxis set to explode all over the city, hoping to create the illusion that an army had invaded Mumbai. Brother Ismail, the team leader, held high a GPS unit, programmed with landing coordinates, as the sea sprayed over them, stinging their sunburned faces.</p><p>They had volunteered for jihad a year before, and been put through religious indoctrination and military training that had taken them from secret mountain-top camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir down to safe houses in the swarming port city of Karachi. Four days ago, at dawn on 22 November, they had finally weighed anchor.</p><p>One day out in open water, they had hijacked an Indian trawler, the first test of everyone&#x2019;s mettle. The second had been saying farewell to their handlers, from whom they had become inseparable, and who melted away into the sea mist, heading back to Pakistan. The third was forcing a captured Indian captain to navigate the seized trawler on towards invincible Mumbai, 309 nautical miles away, in the knowledge that this was the first time they had been alone.</p><p>In reality they were not by themselves. A satellite phone linked them back to a control room in Karachi that called regularly with updates. But these were landlocked boys, from impoverished rural communities, who knew only about chickens and goats, and they were stupefied by shooting stars arcing above them. On the second night, 24 November, they had all lain up on deck and imagined being sucked up into the heavens, while one of the ten had told the story of Sinbad, who had explored the Arabian Sea, where &#x2018;the rocky shore was strewn with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones of luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we shuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap&#x2019;.</p><p>Finally, on 26 November, the GPS had sounded their arrival off the coast of Mumbai, and they had called Karachi to find out what to do with the captured captain. It fell to Ajmal Kasab to act. He had just turned twenty-one and felt compelled to prove his worth. Two others held the Indian sailor down, while Ajmal slit his throat. Blooded, they jumped into a yellow dinghy that pulled them onwards towards the glistening Indian city.</p><p>Each of them, Ajmal recalled, seemed lost in thought. This was a one-way journey that was supposed to culminate with their deaths. There would be no hero&#x2019;s return, no village <i>tamasha</i> (celebration) to fete their victory, and no martyr&#x2019;s poster in the local mosque to immortalize their bravery. There would be no ringing eulogy printed in a jihad magazine. As they approached the city, Ajmal&#x2019;s mother, Noor Elahi, was crouched at home by the fire in Faridkot, frying stuffed <i>parathas</i> for his younger brother and sister, a pot of thick curd sitting up on the kitchen shelf. She had no idea her favourite son was staring at a rapidly nearing foreign shore, his head filled with instructions to &#x2018;kill relentlessly&#x2019;.</p><p>Ajmal had started on this road in November 2007, with another boy of his age, both of them pledging, <i>mujahid</i>-style, to fight for each other until the end. But this boy had had a family who had talked him back home, while other cadres got homesick and were also fetched by concerned fathers, brothers or uncles. By May 2008, half of the would-be warriors had changed their minds. Ajmal had waited at the camp gates, but no one had come for him. In the end, and alone, he had given himself over to the outfit, signing a testament in which he pledged to &#x2018;cut open the kafir&#x2019;s jugular to quench my anger&#x2019;.</p><p>Then, the handlers had packed his rucksack and put him to sea with nine others, all of them wearing new Western clothes, sporting cropped hair and carrying fake Indian IDs.</p><p>At 8.20 p.m., dry land reared up. As he slipped on the pack, Ajmal remembered a promise made by their <i>amir</i>, the cleric who had sent them on their way, conjuring up their deaths: &#x2018;Your faces will glow like the moon. Your bodies will emanate scent, and you will go to paradise.&#x2019;</p><p>The higgledy-piggledy fishermen&#x2019;s <i>chawl</i> (tenement), close to the tourist mecca of Colaba, was deserted when they leapt ashore. Residents were distracted, watching an India-England cricket match on TV. Only local resident Bharat Tandel challenged them, as they ran up to the road: &#x2018;Who are you and where are you going?&#x2019; A shouted answer came back: &#x2018;<i>Hum pehle se hi tang hain. Hume pareshaan mat karo</i> [We are already stressed, so don&#x2019;t pester us].&#x2019;</p><p>An hour later, the growl of gunfire and the bark of explosions reverberated across the city.</p><p>1.</p><p><i>Jadu ghar</i> (House of Magic)</p></p><h2>Another Bowl of Kapusta: The True Life Story of a World War II Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot and P.O.W. in Russia</h2><p>I managed to live through and survive from a most incredible period of time in the History of the World. That was during the Rise, Fall and Aftermath of the Hitler Regime and World War II.Reading this book is like a &#34;Time Capsule.&#34; It brings you into my life from 1925 up until the present time.Over my life span, if someone had predicted to me, what I would have to endure, I would have deemed him &#34;insane.&#34; I had a beautiful childhood and was raised in an upscalem German home. Later on, all that was meaningless to me and all that was important was to somehow survive and stay &#34;alive.&#34; Somehow I overcame the many cruel obstacles and unbearable odds that were set before me.In the end, somehow I survived through it all, and still keep suriving today.</p><p>The Authors originally met via the Internet. His screen name was ME-109 and she didn&#39;t even have a clue as to what that meant. As his life story was revealed to her, she found out that he was a former Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot and Prisoner of War in Russia, during World War II.Hearing his story was for her, like taking a trip back into time.

In a series of pithy, amusing vignettes, Aesop created a vivid cast of characters to demonstrate different aspects of human nature. Here we see a wily fox outwitted by a quick-thinking cicada, a tortoise triumphing over a self-confident hare and a fable-teller named Aesop silencing those who mock him. Each jewel-like fable provides a warning about the consequences of wrong-doing, as well as offering a glimpse into the everyday lives of Ancient Greeks.</p><p>AESOP probably lived in the middle part of the sixth century BC. A statement in Herodotus gives grounds for thinking that he was a slave.</p><h2>The Age of Revolution</h2><p>Between 1789 and 1848 the world was transformed by both the French Revolution and also by the Industrial Revolution that originated in Britain. This &#34;Dual Revolution&#34; created the modern world as we know it. Hobsbawm traces the transformation brought about in every sphere of European life by the Dual Revolution - in the conduct of war and diplomacy; in the new industrial areas and on the land; among peasantry, bougeoise, and aristocracy; in methods of government and of revolution; in science, philosophy and religion; in literature and the arts. But above all he sees this as the period when industrial capitalism established itself in Western Europe and when Europe established the domination over the rest of the world it was to hold for a century.</p><p>This magisterial volume follows the death of ancient traditions, the triumph of new classes, and the emergence of new technologies, sciences, and ideologies, with vast intellectual daring and aphoristic elegance. Part of Eric Hobsbawm&#39;s epic four-volume history of the modern world, along with The Age of Capitalism, The Age of Empire, and The Age of Extremes.Eric Hobsbawm was born in Alexandria in 1917 and was educated in Vienna, Berlin, London and Cambridge. He is a fellow of the British Academy and currently lectures for the New York School of Social Research.</p><h2>Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-History of the Great Chain of Being (Women And Culture Series)</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Centaurs and Amazons, Page duBois offers a prehistory of hierarchy. Using structural anthropology, symbolic analysis, and recent literary theory, she demonstrates a shift in Greek thought from the fifth to the fourth century B.C. that had a profound influence upon subsequent Western culture and politics.</p> <p>Through an analysis of mythology, drama, sculpture, architecture, and Greek vase painting, duBois documents the transition from a system of thought that organized the experience of difference in terms of polarity and analogy to one based upon a relatively rigid hierarchical scheme. This was the beginning of "the great chain of being," the philosophical construct that all life was organized in minute gradations of superiority and inferiority. This scheme, in various guises, has continued to influence philosophical and political thought.</p> <p>The author's intelligent and discriminating use of scholarship from various fields makes Centaurs and Amazons an impressive interdisciplinary study of interest to classicists, feminist scholars, historians, art historians, anthropologists, and political scientists.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Page duBois</b> is Professor of Classics and Comparative Literature at the University of California at San Diego. She is the author of <i>Sowing the Body: Psychoanalysis and Ancient Representations of Women</i> and <i>Torture and Truth</i>."The myths of <i>Centaurs and Amazons</i> are particularly illuminating; here we see a conceptual parallelism of beast and woman that have to be defeated to ensure the survival of Hellenism itself. . . . The picture that emerges from Professor duBois's investigations of the archaic and classical periods is not a very pretty one to contemplate, but the lessons are there to be learned."<br> --Gregory Nagy, Harvard University<br><br>"Its great virtue lies in its bringing together of material in various fields&#x2014;literature, philosophy, art, history&#x2014;in order to characterize basic ways of thinking in a culture."<br> &#x2014;<i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i> (<i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i> 1999-04-01)</p><h2>Devoted in Death - LARGE PRINT</h2><p>Large Print edition of latest series featuring Eve Dallas.</p><p></p><h2>The Craft Companion: A Witch&#39;s Journal</h2><p><p>Celebrate the changing of the seasons and the beauty and power of the Moon, the Stars, and the Sun.

(Be sure to keep the gifts in your hand until you're ready for them to leave. The fey are sly folk and won't stay long unless you have something that they want!)</p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br>If you get stuck in traffic on the way to the service station and it looks like you might run out of gas, try the following chant while visualizing the fuel expanding inside your tank.

So mote it be!</p> <br><p> <br>Repeat this spell for eight more days, tying knots of equal distance until there are nine. Then put the cord in a safe place and wear it on the Sabbats.</p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br>To bring rain, wait until a sunny morning, then pick a handful of ferns.

Light the candle, then enchant each stone with the following verse.</p> <br><p> <br>Bring to me my heart's desire<br> <br>By Elements of Air and Fire<br> <br>By Water Element, as well<br> <br>Of which the concentrated gel<br> <br>Makes Your existence and the Earth<br> <br>I ask you this in love and mirth</p> <br><p> <br>Place the stones on the altar in front of the candle, and allow the wick to burn down completely. Then bury the stones in the ground.</p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br>For this spell, all you need is a glass of water. Take it to wherever you are most comfortable&#x2015;the couch, the kitchen table, or the bed, for example&#x2015;and relax. Then blow across the water's surface and say: </p> <br><p> <br>I heal myself of (problem)<br> <br>With this water, I am free<br> <br>By the power of Ancients<br> <br>And my will, so mote it be</p> <br><p> <br>When you are finished, drink the water and know that healing is on its way.</p> <br><p> <br> </p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br>To keep all safe from harm during spellwork, use the following binding chant with every magical effort you perform.</p> <br><p> <br>By karmic power of number three<br> <br>This spell tied and knotted be<br> <br>So that its contents stay together<br> <br>And can't harm human, beast, or weather</p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br></p> <br><p> <br>Go outside on a sunny day and pick somedandelions, then fashion them into a small wreath.

Traven's six Jungle Novels which together form an epic of the birth of the Mexican Revolution. The young Indian who is the hero of The Carreta is an ox-cart driver. More sophisticated than most of his companions who work in debt-slavery in the great mahogany plantations, Andrés can read and hopes to go back to his wife. But he labors with no awareness of how really impossible this is. Pressing down on him is the plight of his father, who was also sold to the montería. Andrés believes he can never return to his wife until he repays his father's debt. Traven's purpose in the Jungle Novels is to describe the conditions of a people who are ripe for revolt, and to trace the beginnings of consciousness which result in the determination to revolt. In <i>The Carreta</i> he brings his remarkable narrative talents to bear on the coming of age of Andrés and the oppressive world in which he finds he must make his way. "Traven is a very great writer .... His work must be read."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>.</p><p>The mysterious B. Traven (1890&#x2013;1969) was born in Chicago, spent his youth in Germany as an itinerant actor and revolutionary journalist, became a seaman on tramp steamers, settled in Mexico in the early 1920s, and began recording his experience in novels and stories. In the United States his best-known novel is <i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Pastoral Poetry and an Essay on Criticism (The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope, vol. 1)</h2><p>Book itself is in good condition. the dust cover has some tears in it.</p><p></p><h2>Be the Change</h2><p>A former Goldman Sachs trader and author of the widely praised &#34;Goldman Sachs: A Culture of Success&#34;, Lisa Endlich knows everyone who&#39;s anyone in the world of philanthropy.Now, we venture inside that world with her as she interviews the top names in philanthropy today: Melinda Gates, one of the driving forces behind the largest philanthropic organization in the world, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Bob and Suzanne Wright - he&#39;s the former Vice-Chairman of GE and longtime head of NBC Universal, their Autism Speaks has become the number 1 autism organization worldwide; Bill Donaldson, former head of the SEC; Charles Best and Peter Bloom, the Chairman and CEO of the highly successful organization Donors Choose; Connie Duckworth, the former Goldman Sachs executive who left her coveted Wall Street job to start a not-for-profit rug merchant that focuses on providing employment to impoverished Afghan women and children; and, Anonymous - arguably the leading anonymous donor today, who&#39;s given away millions in secret.She also interviews: Bernie and Tim Marquez, CEO of Venoco oil; Philip and Donna Berber, former CEO of CyBerCorp; Tim Dibble, Private Equity, Year Up; Peter Bloom, partner, Atlantic private equity, chairman of Donorschoose. org; and, Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investments and the Robin Hood Foundation. Endlich&#39;s widely praised skills (Goldman Sachs garned uniform accolades from the media) and unmatchable connections in philanthropy result in a book that&#39;s a terrific combination of engaging, smart writing and engrossing interviews.</p><p><p> Lisa Endlich is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling book <i>Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success</i>. She has worked as a management consultant, a political fundraiser, and a Wall Street trader. She supports many charities and has traveled to KwaZulu-Natal to work in an AIDS program. She resides in New York. </p>With a light dose of narrative background and a heavy emphasis on an interview format, Endlich (<i>Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success</i>) allows philanthropists to voice their passion for large-scale charitable organizing and giving. The authors subjects are an illustrious bunch, including Melinda Gates and hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, and they champion such diverse causes as autism, poverty in Ethiopia, job training for the inner-city poor and need-based educational scholarships for college. Endlich keeps her treatment balanced by focusing on initial project failures and challenges as well as successes and brilliantly pulls together the common threads and motivations of these profiled philanthropists. The financiers, entrepreneurs and even one Olympian all agree that their extraordinary luck in life and ability to empathize factored heavily into their desire to give back in a big way to those in need; it is giving that adds a narrative to their lives. Given the excesses in corporate America and on Wall Street lately, this heartening book proves that even the most successful individuals in business can also devote themselves to something that touched them so profoundly that they could not turn away. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Includes every room in the house and shows how classic need not be outdated.</p><p><b>Henrietta Spencer-Churchill</b> is the daughter of the 11th Duke of Marlborough, whose family home is Blenheim Palace. She runs the highly successful interior design company Woodstock Designs in England, and has clients in the United States and the UK. Her fabric and wallpaper collections are sold through leading interior design stores as well as in her own shops in London and Woodstock, England, and through Grey Watkins in the United States. She is a regular lecturer and is the author of six books, including the popular <i>Classic Entertaining</i>.<br>A childhood spent in the Baroque splendour of Blenheim Palace gives Henrietta Spencer-Churchill all the authority she needs to discuss classic design styles from Medieval to present day. In this gloriously illustrated work, she reveals the best of those designs, highlighting how individual elements can be incorporated into our homes today. She emphasises the importance of complementing the architectural with the furniture and furnishings to present a style easy on the eye and in keeping with the age of the house. Country cottages, palaces, manor houses and Victorian homes are all featured, accompanied by a history of the style of the time and gentle instruction on how the rooms depicted have been put together in such a way as to make them perfect partners with the house itself. With the easy availability today of reproduction furniture and mouldings, even houses which have lost touch with their origins can be restored to bring back their original feel. Architectural salvage and antique markets unearth features for those with a more perfectionist mind. But repro or original, the art, as Henrietta stipulates over and over, is to stay in tune with the home&#39;s initial style. A high-beamed Medieval hall was not designed for a plethora of heavy Victorian furniture and artefacts. Similarly Victorian houses were not designed for minimalist tastes. Careful study of the individual designs will result in a more natural and beautiful look for your period home. Ostensibly aimed at owners of period homes, the book will also appeal to those who appreciate the finer things in life. The visual feasts of Andrew Wood contain a wealth of inspiration for those just looking for classic design ideas.</p><h2>The Archbishop in Andalusia: An Archbishop Blackie Ryan Novel (Bishop Blackie Ryan Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Taking leave of his usual Chicago haunts, Archbishop John Blackwood Ryan travels to the south of Spain in this latest mystery by bestselling author Andrew M. Greeley. Ostensibly &#x201c;Blackie&#x201d; is in the historic city of Seville to attend a conference on American philosophy, but a far more critical assignment also requires his attention. The local cardinal has summoned the wily archbishop to Spain in hopes that Blackie can avert a murder before it happens.<br><br>The threat of violence hangs ominously over the regal palace of a family of wealthy Spanish aristocrats. Dona Teresa, a pious widow whose exotic beauty unsettles even Blackie, finds herself beset by avaricious relatives determined to control her life and fortune. A tangled web of obligations, traditions, and frustrated sexual desires binds the family together even as they bitterly contend against one another. With three generations of passionate nobility sharing the same roof, it seems only a matter of time before pride, greed, and lust leads to bloodshed.<br><br>But while the archbishop attempts to forestall a modern-day Spanish tragedy, dramatic events back in Chicago conspire to change his life forever. . . .<br><br><i>The Archbishop in Andalusia</i> opens an exciting new chapter in the illustrious career of one of Andrew Greeley&#x2019;s most beloved characters.</p></p><p><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, Father Andrew M. Greeley built an international assemblage of devout fans over a career spanning five decades. His books include the Bishop Blackie Ryan novels, including <i>The Archbishop in Andalusia</i>, the Nuala Anne McGrail novels, including <i>Irish Tweed</i>, and <i>The Cardinal Virtues</i>. He was the author of over 50 best-selling novels and more than 100 works of non-fiction, and his writing has been translated into 12 languages.</p><p>Father Greeley was a Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona and a Research Associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. In addition to scholarly studies and popular fiction, for many years he penned a weekly column appearing in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and other newspapers. He was also a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i>, <i>America </i>and <i>Commonweal</i>, and was interviewed regularly on national radio and television. He authored hundreds of articles on sociological topics, ranging from school desegregation to elder sex to politics and the environment.</p><p>Throughout his priesthood, Father Greeley unflinchingly urged his beloved Church to become more responsive to evolving concerns of Catholics everywhere. His clear writing style, consistent themes and celebrity stature made him a leading spokesperson for generations of Catholics. He chronicled his service to the Church in two autobiographies, <i>Confessions of a Parish Priest</i> and <i>Furthermore!</i></p><p>In 1986, Father Greeley established a $1 million Catholic Inner-City School Fund, providing scholarships and financial support to schools in the Chicago Archdiocese with a minority student body of more than 50 percent. In 1984, he contributed a $1 million endowment to establish a chair in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago. He also funded an annual lecture series, &#x201c;The Church in Society,&#x201d; at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Mundelein, Illinois, from which he received his S.T.L. in 1954.</p><p>Father Greeley received many honors and awards, including honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland at Galway, the University of Arizona and Bard College. A Chicago native, he earned his M.A. in 1961 and his Ph.D. in 1962 from the University of Chicago.</p><p>Father Greeley was a penetrating student of popular culture, deeply engaged with the world around him, and a lifelong Chicago sports fan, cheering for the Bulls, Bears and the Cubs. Born in 1928, he died in May 2013 at the age of 85.</p>Greeley's breezy 17th Blackie Ryan novel (after 2007's <i>The Bishop at the Lake</i>) takes Ryan to the south of Spain for a conference, where the local cardinal requests his help preventing the murder of a beautiful and wealthy widow, Do�a Teresa Maria, duchess of Seville, whose many relatives envy her money, title and power in the community. Blackie's sister, meanwhile, has put pressure on Blackie to nudge his nephew Joseph and Joseph's girlfriend, Peggy Anne Nolan, who have accompanied him on the trip, into setting a date for their wedding. To add to his concerns, Blackie receives word from the U.S. of the ill health of his superior, the archbishop of Chicago. Armchair travelers will relish the descriptions of Seville and Cordoba, along with the details of Spanish history and customs. Indeed, some readers may feel the travelogue aspects overshadow the mystery untangling, but all will enjoy Greeley's wit and good humor. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the major league draft of 1971, the first player chosen from the State of Oklahoma was Ron Williamson. When he signed with the Oakland A&#39;s, he said goodbye to his hometown of Ad</p><p>John Grisham tackles nonfiction for the first time with <i>The Innocent Man</i>, a true tale about murder and injustice in a small town (that reads like one of his own bestselling novels). <i>The Innocent Man</i> chronicles the story of Ron Williamson, how he was arrested and charged with a crime he did not commit, how his case was (mis)handled and how an innocent man was sent to death row. Grisham's first work of nonfiction is shocking, disturbing, and enthralling--a must read for fiction and nonfiction fans. We had the opportunity to talk with John Grisham about the case and the book, read his responses below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> <b> 20 Second Interview: A Few Words with John Grisham</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> After almost two decades of writing fiction, what compelled you to write non-fiction, particularly investigative journalism?<br> <b>A:</b> I was never tempted to write non-fiction, primarily because it's too much work. However, obviously, I love a good legal thriller, and the story of Ron Williamson has all the elements of a great suspenseful story.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why this case?<br> <b>A:</b> Ron Williamson and I are about the same age and we both grew up in small towns in the south. We both dreamed of being major league baseball players. Ron had the talent, I did not. When he left a small town in 1971 to pursue his dreams of major league glory, many thought he would be the next Mickey Mantle, the next great one from the state of Oklahoma. The story of Ron ending up on Death Row and almost being executed for a murder he did not commit was simply too good to pass up.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> How did you go about your research?<br> <b>A:</b> I started with his family. Ron is survived by two sisters who took care of him for most of his life. They gave me complete access to the family records, photographs, Ron's mental health records, and so on. There was also a truckload of trial transcripts, depositions, appeals, etc., that took about 18 months to organize and review. Many of the characters in the story are still alive and I traveled to Oklahoma countless times to interview them.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Did your training as a lawyer help you?<br> <b>A:</b> Very much so. It enabled me to understand the legal issues involved in Ron's trial and his appeals. It also allowed me, as it always does, to be able to speak the language with lawyers and judges.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Throughout your book you mention, <i>The Dreams of Ada: A True Story of Murder, Obsession, and a Small Town</i>. How did you come across that book, and how did it impact your writing <i>The Innocent Man</i>?<br> <b>A:</b> Several of the people in Oklahoma I met mentioned <i>The Dreams of Ada</i> to me, and I read it early on in the process. It is an astounding book, a great example of true crime writing, and I relied upon it heavily during my research. Robert Mayer, the author, was completely cooperative, and kept meticulous notes from his research 20 years earlier. Many of the same characters are involved in his story and mine.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> You take on some pretty controversial and heated topics in your book--the death penalty, prisoner&#x2019;s rights, DNA analysis, police conduct, and more--were any of your own beliefs challenged by this story and its outcome?<br> <b>A:</b> None were challenged, but my eyes were open to the world of wrongful convictions. Even as a former criminal defense attorney, I had never spent much time worrying about wrongful convictions. But, unfortunately, they happen all the time in this country, and with increasing frequency.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> So many of the key players in this case are either still in office or practicing attorneys. Many family members and friends still live in the same small town. How do you think <i>The Innocent Man</i> will impact this community and other small rural towns as they struggle with the realities of the justice system? <br> <b>A:</b> Exonerations seem to be happening weekly. And with each one of them, the question is asked--how can an innocent man be convicted and kept in prison for 20 years? My book is the story of only one man, but it is a good example of how things can go terribly wrong with our judicial system. I have no idea how the book will be received in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma, or any other town.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What do you hope your readers will take away from <i>The Innocent Man</i>?<br> <b>A:</b> A better understanding of how innocent people can be convicted, and a greater concern for the need to reimburse and rehabilitate innocent men after they have been released.<br><br> <p></p>John Grisham is the author of thirty-five bestselling novels, the international number one non-fiction debut The Innocent Man and a series of short stories entitled Ford County.

Wayne Sharf slid across Winky Butterfield&#x2019;s pasture like a<br>greased weasel headed for a chicken house. He carried two heavy<br>nylon leashes with choke-chain collars, two nylon muzzles with<br>Velcro straps, and a center-cut pork chop.<br>The target was Butterfield&#x2019;s kennel, a chain-link enclosure in the<br>backyard, where Butterfield kept his two black Labs, one young,<br>one older. The pork chop would be used to make friends.<br><br>D. Wayne was wearing camo, head to foot, which was no change:<br>he always wore camo, head to foot. So did his children.<br>His ex-wife, Truly, whom he still occasionally visited, wore various<br>pieces of camo, depending on daily fashion demands&#x2014;more at<br>Walmart, less at Target. She also had eight pairs of camo under<br>pants, size 4XL and 5XL, which she wore on a rotating basis: two<br>each of Mossy Oak, Realtree, Legend, and God&#x2019;s Country, which<br>prompted D. Wayne to tell her one night, as he peeled them off,<br>&#x201c;This really is God&#x2019;s country, know what I&#x2019;m sayin&#x2019;, honeybunch?&#x201d;<br><br>His new, alternative honeybunch wore black cotton, which she<br><br>called &#x201c;panties,&#x201d; and which didn&#x2019;t do much for D. Wayne. Just some<br>thing hot about camo.<br><br>A few thousand cells in the back of his brain were sifting through<br>all of that as D. Wayne crossed a split-rail fence into Butterfield&#x2019;s<br>yard, and one of the dogs, the young one, barked twice. There were<br>no lights in the house, and none came on. D. Wayne paused in his<br>approach, watching, then slipped the pork chop out of its plastic<br>bag. He sat for a couple of minutes, giving the dogs a chance to smell<br>the meat; while he waited, his own odor caught up with him, a combination<br>of sweat and whiskey-blend Copenhagen. If Butterfield<br>had the nose of a deer or a wolf, he would have been worried.<br><br>But Butterfield didn&#x2019;t, and D. Wayne started moving again. He<br>got to the kennel, where the dogs were waiting, slobbering like<br>hounds . . . because they were hounds. He turned on the hunter&#x2019;s<br>red, low-illumination LED lights mounted in his hat brim, ripped<br>the pork chop in half, held the pieces three feet apart, and pushed<br>them through the chain link. The dogs were all over the meat: and<br>while they were choking it down, he flipped the latch on the kennel<br>gate and duckwalked inside.<br><br>&#x201c;Here you go, boys, good boys,&#x201d; he muttered. The dogs came<br>over to lick his face and look for more pork chop, the young dog<br>prancing around him, and he slipped the choke collars over their<br>heads, one at a time. The young one took the muzzle okay&#x2014;the<br>muzzle was meant to prevent barking, not biting&#x2014;but the older<br>one resisted, growled, and then barked, twice, three times. A light<br>came on in the back of the Butterfield house.<br><br>D. Wayne said, &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; dropped the big dog&#x2019;s muzzle, and<br>dragged the two dogs out of the kennel toward the fence. Again,<br>the younger one came without much resistance at first, but the<br>older one dug in. Another light came on, this one by the Butterfield<br>side door, and D. Wayne said, &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; and he picked up the bigger<br>dog, two arms under its belly, and yanking the other one along on<br>the leash, cleared the fence and headed across the pasture at an<br>awkward trot.<br><br>The side door opened on Butterfield&#x2019;s house, and D. Wayne,<br>having forgotten about the red LEDs on his hat brim, made the mistake<br>of looking back. Butterfield was standing under the porch<br>light, and saw him. Butterfield shouted, &#x201c;Hey! Hey!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Carol,<br>somebody&#x2019;s took the dogs,&#x201d; and then, improbably, he went back<br>inside the house and D. Wayne thought for seven or eight seconds<br>that he&#x2019;d caught a break. His truck was only forty yards or so away<br>now, and he was moving as fast as he could while carrying the<br>bigger dog, which must&#x2019;ve weighed eighty pounds.<br><br>Then Butterfield reappeared and this time he was carrying a<br>gun. He yelled again, &#x201c;Hey! Hey!&#x201d; and let off a half-dozen rounds,<br>and D. Wayne said, &#x201c;My gosh,&#x201d; and threw the big dog through the<br>back door of his truck topper and then hoisted the smaller dog up<br>by his neck and threw him inside after the bigger one.<br><br>Another volley of bullets cracked overhead, making a truly unpleasant<br>whip-snap sound, but well off to one side. D. Wayne realized<br>that Butterfield couldn&#x2019;t actually see the truck in the dark of<br>the night, and through the mist. Since D. Wayne was a semi-pro dog<br>snatcher, he had the truck&#x2019;s interior and taillights on a cut-off<br>switch, and when he got in and fired that mother up, none of the<br>lights came on.<br><br>There was still the rumble of the truck, though, and Butterfield<br>fired another volley, and then D. Wayne was gone up the nearly, but<br>not quite, invisible road. A half-mile along, he turned on his lights<br>and accelerated away, and at the top of the hill that overlooked the<br>Butterfield place, he looked back and saw headlights.<br><br>Butterfield was coming.<br><br>D. Wayne dropped the hammer. The chase was short, because<br>D. Wayne had made provisions. At the Paxton place, over the crest<br>of the third low hill in a roller-coaster stretch of seven hills, he<br>swerved off the road, down the drive, and around behind the Paxton<br>kids&#x2019; bus shack, where the kids waited for the school bus on<br>wintry days.Butterfield went past at a hundred miles an hour,<br>and fifteen seconds later D. Wayne was going the other way.<br><br>A clean getaway, but D. Wayne had about peed himself when<br>Butterfield started working that gun. Had to be a better way to<br>make a living, he thought, as he took a left on a winding road back<br>toward home.<br><br>Not that he could easily think of one. There was stealing dogs,<br>cooking meth, and stripping copper wire and pipes out of unoccupied<br>summer cabins.<br><br>That was about it, in D. Wayne&#x2019;s world.<br><br>2<br>Virgil Flowers nearly fell off the bed when the phone began to<br>vibrate. The bed was narrow and Frankie Nobles was using up the<br>middle and the other side. Virgil had to crawl over her naked body<br>to get to the phone, not an entirely unpleasant process, and she<br>muttered, &#x201c;What? Again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Phone,&#x201d; Virgil said. He groaned and added, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be anything<br>good.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at the face of the phone and said, &#x201c;Johnson Johnson.&#x201d;<br>At that moment the phone stopped ringing.<br><br>Frankie was up on her elbows, where she could see the clock,<br>and said, &#x201c;At three in the morning? The dumbass has been arrested<br>for something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t call for that,&#x201d; Virgil said. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s not dumb.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s two kinds of dumb,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;Actual and deliberate.<br>Johnson&#x2019;s the most deliberate dumbass I ever met. That whole<br>live-chicken-toss contest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, it was for a good cause.&#x201d; Virgil touched the callback<br>tab, and Johnson picked up on the first ring.<br><br>&#x201c;Virgil, Jesus, we got big trouble, man. You remember Winky<br>Butterfield?&#x201d; Johnson sounded wide awake.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t believe so.&#x201d;<br><br>After a moment of silence Johnson said, &#x201c;Maybe I didn&#x2019;t introduce<br>you, come to think of it. Maybe it was somebody else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Can I go back to sleep?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Virgil, this is serious shit. Somebody dognapped Winky&#x2019;s black<br>Labs. You gotta get your ass over here, man, while the trail is fresh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, Johnson . . . dogs? You called me at three in the morning<br>about dogs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re family, man . . . you gotta do something.&#x201d;<br><br>At ten o&#x2019;clock the next morning, Virgil kissed Frankie good-bye<br>and walked out to his truck, which was parked at the curb with the<br>boat already hooked up. Virgil was recently back from New Mexico,<br>where he&#x2019;d caught and released every tiger musky in what he<br>suspected was the remotest musky lake in North America. Nice<br>fish, too, the biggest a finger-width short of fifty inches. He could<br>still smell them as he walked past the boat and climbed into the cab<br>of his 4Runner.<br><br>The day was warm, and promising hot. The sun was doing its<br>job out in front of the truck, but the sky had a sullen gray look<br>about it. There&#x2019;d been a quarter-inch of rain over the past twenty-<br>four hours, and as he rolled out of Mankato, Minnesota, the countryside<br>looked notably damp. But it was August, the best time of the<br>year, and he was on the road, operating, elbow out the window,<br>pheasants running across the road in front of him . . . nothing to<br>complain about.<br><br>As Virgil rode along, he thought about Frankie. He&#x2019;d known her<br>as Ma Nobles before he&#x2019;d fallen into bed with her, because she<br>had about a hundred children; or, at least, it felt that way. She was<br>a compelling armful, and Virgil&#x2019;s thoughts had drifted again to<br>marriage, as they had three times before. The first three had been<br>disasters, because, he thought, he had poor taste in women. He<br>reconsidered: no, that wasn&#x2019;t quite right. His three wives had all<br>been pretty decent women, but, he thought, he was simply a poor<br>judge of the prospects for compatibility.<br><br>He and Frankie did not have that problem; they just got along.<br><br>And Virgil thought about Lucas Davenport for a while&#x2014;<br>Davenport was his boss at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,<br>and not a bad guy, though a trifle intense. There was a distinct possibility<br>that he would not be pleased with the idea of Virgil working<br>a dognapping case. Especially since the shit had hit the fan up north,<br>where a couple of high school kids had tripped over an abandoned<br>farm cistern full of dead bodies.<br><br>But Johnson Johnson was a hard man to turn down. Virgil<br>thought he might be able to sneak in a couple good working days<br>before Davenport even found out what he was doing. A dognapping,<br>he thought, shouldn&#x2019;t take too much time, one way or the<br>other. The dogs might already be in Texas, chasing armadillos, or<br>whatever it was they chased in Texas.<br><br>Dognapping. He&#x2019;d had calls on it before, though he&#x2019;d never investigated<br>one, and they&#x2019;d always been during hunting season, or<br>shortly before. Didn&#x2019;t usually see one this early in the year.<br><br>Johnson Johnson ran a lumber mill, specializing in hardwood<br>timber&#x2014;three varieties of oak, bird&#x2019;s-eye maple, butternut, hickory,<br>and some walnut and cherry&#x2014;for flooring and cabinetry, with a<br>side business of providing specialty cuts for sculptors. He and Virgil<br>had met at the University of Minnesota, where they were studying<br>women and baseball. Virgil had been a fair third baseman for a<br>couple years, while Johnson was a better-than-fair catcher. He<br>might even have caught onto the bottom edge of the pros, if baseball<br>hadn&#x2019;t bored him so badly. Johnson&#x2019;s mill was a mile outside<br>Trippton, Minnesota, in Buchanan County, in the Driftless Area<br>along the Mississippi River.<br><br>The Driftless Area had always interested Virgil, who had taken<br>a degree in ecological science. Basically, the Driftless Area was a<br>chunk of territory in Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Iowa, and Illinois<br>that had escaped the last glaciation&#x2014;the glaciers had simply<br>flowed around it, joining up again to the south, leaving the Driftless<br>Area as an island in an ocean of ice. When the glaciers melted, they<br>usually left behind loose dirt and rock, which was called drift. Not in<br>the Driftless Area . . .<br><br>Physically, the land was cut by steep valleys, up to six hundred feet<br>deep, running down to the Mississippi River. Compared to the farm-<br>lands all around it, the Driftless Area was less fertile, and covered<br>with hardwood forests. Towns were small and far between, set mostly<br>along the river. The whole area was reminiscent of the Appalachians.<br><br>Road time from Virgil&#x2019;s home, in Mankato, to Trippton, on the<br>river, was two and a half hours.<br><br>For most of it Virgil put both the truck and his brain on cruise<br>control. He&#x2019;d driven the route a few dozen times, and there was not<br>a lot to look at that he hadn&#x2019;t seen before. Trippton was at the bottom<br>of a long hill, on a sandspit that stuck out into the Mississippi;<br>it was a religious town, with almost as many churches as bars. Virgil<br>arrived at lunchtime, got caught in a minor traffic jam between the<br>town&#x2019;s three stoplights, and eventually wedged into a boat-sized<br>double-length parking lane behind Shanker&#x2019;s Bar and Grill.<br><br>Johnson Johnson came rambling out the back door as Virgil<br>pulled in. Johnson Johnson&#x2019;s father, Big Johnson, had been an<br>outboard-motor enthusiast who fairly well lived on the Mississippi.<br>He&#x2019;d named his sons after outboard motors, and while Mercury<br>Johnson had gotten off fairly easy, Johnson Johnson had been stuck<br>with the odd double name. He was a large man, like his father, and<br>well tattooed.<br><br>&#x201c;I can smell them fuckin&#x2019; muskies from here,&#x201d; he said, as Virgil<br>climbed out of the truck. He leaned into the boat and said, &#x201c;I hope<br>you brought something besides those fuckin&#x2019; phone poles,&#x201d; by<br>which he meant musky gear.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I got some of everything,&#x201d; Virgil said. &#x201c;What about<br>these dogs? You find them yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Johnson said. He was uncharacteristically grim.<br>&#x201c;Come on inside. I got a whole bunch of ol&#x2019; boys and girls for you<br>to talk to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re having a meeting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re having a lynch mob,&#x201d; Johnson said.<br><br>Virgil followed him in. One of the trucks he passed in the parking<br>lot had a bumper sticker that asked, &#x201c;Got Hollow Points?&#x201d; Another<br>said: &#x201c;Heavily Armed . . . and easily pissed.&#x201d; A third one: &#x201c;Point and<br>Click . . . means you&#x2019;re out of ammo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, jeez,&#x201d; Virgil said.<br><br>Virgil was a tall man, made taller by his cowboy boots. He wore<br>his blond hair too long for a cop&#x2014;but country-long like Waylon Jennings,<br>not sculptural long, like some New Jersey douche bag, so he<br>got along okay.<br><br>He dressed in jeans and band T-shirts, in this case, a rare pirated<br>&#x201c;Dogs Die in Hot Cars&#x201d; shirt, which he hoped the local &#x2019;necks<br>would take for a sign of solidarity. To his usual ensemble, he added<br>a black sport coat when he needed to hide a gun, which wasn&#x2019;t<br>often. Most times, he left the guns in the truck.<br><br>He sometimes wore a straw cowboy hat, on hot days out in the<br>sun; at other times, a ball cap, his current favorite a black-on-black<br>Iowa Hawkeyes hat, given to him by a devout Iowegian.<br><br>Johnson led the way through the parking lot door, down a beer-<br>smelling corridor past the restrooms, which had signs that said<br>&#x201c;Pointers&#x201d; and &#x201c;Setters,&#x201d; to the back end of the bar, where twenty<br>or so large outdoorsy-looking men and women hunched over rickety<br>plastic tables, drinking beer and eating a variety of fried everything,<br>with link sausages on the side.<br><br>When Virgil caught up with him, Johnson said, in a loud voice,<br>without any sign of levity, &#x201c;Okay, boys and girls.

His essays have appeared in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, Smithsonian Science 80, and Wigwag. He lives in Culver City, California.Biologist Jordan here observes medfly courtship, gorilla motherhood, sea gull nesting squabbles and other remarkable activities in the animal world. Wherever he looks, he finds parallels with human behavior, and he speculates that the human mind is actually an extension of the animal mind. Whether he writes of fruit bats emerging eerily from a eucalyptus grove at dusk, the magical universe of insects in a field of alfalfa or a rat on a power line silhouetted against the moon, Jordan's prose is scintillating, for he has a poet's ability to enchant and a naturalist's talent for opening our eyes to the wonders of the animal world. Above all, he succeeds in making us humble about human reasoning capacity, for it may not be as original or as beneficial as we like to think. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Everything I Never Told You (Thorndike Press Large Print Reviewers&#39; Choice)</h2><p>"Lydia is dead. But they don't know this yet" . . . So begins the story of this exquisite debut novel, about a Chinese American family living in 1970s small-town Ohio. Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee; their middle daughter, a girl who inherited her mother's bright blue eyes and her father's jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursue--in Marilyn's case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in James's case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the center of every party. <br> When Lydia's body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together tumbles into chaos, forcing them to confront the long-kept secrets that have been slowly pulling them apart. James, consumed by guilt, sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to find a responsible party, no matter what the cost. Lydia's older brother, Nathan, is certain that the neighborhood bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But it's the youngest of the family--Hannah--who observes far more than anyone realizes and who may be the only one who knows the truth about what happened. <br> A profoundly moving story of family, history, and the meaning of home, "Everything I Never Told You" is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait, exploring the divisions between cultures and the rifts within a family, and uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another.</p><p><p><strong>Selected by the Amazon Editors as the #1 Book of the Year:</strong> <em>Lydia is dead.</em> From the first sentence of Celeste Ng&#x2019;s stunning debut, we know that the oldest daughter of the Chinese-American Lee family has died. What follows is a novel that explores alienation, achievement, race, gender, family, and identity--as the police must unravel what has happened to Lydia, the Lee family must uncover the sister and daughter that they hardly knew. There isn&#x2019;t a false note in this book, and my only concern in describing my profound admiration for <em>Everything I Never Told You</em> is that it might raise unachievable expectations in the reader. But it&#x2019;s that good. Achingly, precisely, and sensitively written. <em>--Chris Schluep</em></p>Celeste Ng grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Shaker Heights, Ohio, in a family of scientists.

For many years, she practiced her trade successfully while marrying three times, once to a much older man who left her an extremely rich widow. This biography chronicles the life of this extraordinary "ordinary" woman who tried to make a place for herself and other women in the world by asserting her own independence inside and outside of the home. <br><br>As an importer and retailer of British goods, Murray conducted business with merchants and manufacturers in England and buyers in the American colonies, even traveling to London to select her own stock. Deeply satisfied by her work and the economic freedom it brought her, she acted as mentor to other women, helping them to establish shops of their own. She also protected her autonomy by demanding prenuptial agreements from her second and third husbands that gave her a measure of control over her property that was rare for a married woman of her day. <br><br>The spirit of independence that Murray so valued in herself and nurtured in other women was severely tested by the upheavals of the American Revolution. With strong loyalties to both Britain and America, she was torn by the conflict, especially when close relatives chose opposing sides and her third husband abandoned her, leaving her to defend the family estate alone. Her wartime experiences&#x2015;wild midnight rides, accusations of being a spy, quartering both royal and rebel troops, and brief imprisonment&#x2015;vividly capture the turmoil of the Revolution and highlight the range of her political commitments.</p><p>A woman shopkeeper&#x2019;s struggle to achieve economic self-sufficiency in eighteenth-century Boston.Patricia Cleary is associate professor of history at California State University, Long Beach.</p><h2>Appetite for Change: How the Counterculture Took On the Food Industry</h2><p><p>In this engaging inquiry, originally published in 1989 and now fully updated for the twenty-first century, Warren J. Belasco considers the rise of the "countercuisine" in the 1960s, the subsequent success of mainstream businesses in turning granola, herbal tea, and other "revolutionary" foodstuffs into profitable products; the popularity of vegetarian and vegan diets; and the increasing availability of organic foods.<b>From reviews of the previous edition:</b>"Although Red Zinger never became our national drink, food and eating changed in America as a result of the social revolution of the 1960s. According to Warren Belasco, there was political ferment at the dinner table as well as in the streets. In this lively and intelligent mixture of narrative history and cultural analysis, Belasco argues that middle-class America eats differently today than in the 1950 because of the way the counterculture raised the national consciousness about food."&#x2015;Joan Jacobs Brumberg, <i>The Nation </i>"This book documents not only how cultural rebels created a new set of foodways, brown rice and all, but also how American capitalists commercialized these innovations to their own economic advantage. Along the way, the author discusses the significant relationship between the rise of a 'countercuisine' and feminism, environmentalism, organic agriculture, health consciousness, the popularity of ethnic cuisine, radical economic theory, granola bars, and Natural Lite Beer. Never has history been such a good read!"&#x2015;<i>The Digest: A Review for the Interdisciplinary Study of Food </i>"Now comes an examination of... the sweeping change in American eating habits ushered in by hippiedom in rebellion against middle-class America.... <i>Appetite for Change</i> tells how the food industry co-opted the health-food craze, discussing such hip capitalists as the founder of Celestial Seasonings teas; the rise of health-food cookbooks; how ethnic cuisine came to enjoy new popularity; and how watchdog agencies like the FDA served, arguably, more often as sleeping dogs than as vigilant ones."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>"A challenging and sparkling book....

Thanks to his warning, when next I heard the rhythm of hooves on stone, I turned aside from the track. If I had not lamed Annie, damn my stupidity, she could have carried me swiftly into the forest and away&#x2014;but as it was, we did not have much time. I grabbed Annie by the forelock and whispered to her, &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d; But she had not hobbled much more than ten limping steps off the path when, with his chain mail jangling and the saddle leather creaking under his armored weight, the knight rode past. All I could do was freeze like a rabbit, staring, and hope the knight did not look my way. Luck was with me. He rode with his visor down, so unless he turned his head he could see only straight before him. I noticed smears of brownish red on his shield and armor&#x2014;at first I thought it was rust, but a moment later I knew better&#x2014;then I had to choke back horror that would have made me cry out. At his knee, hanging by its hair, swung the severed, dripping head of what had once been a man.<br><br>He rode past, and I leaned against Annie&#x2019;s solid warmth and took several deep breaths to keep from retching.<br><br>Then we went on. A small distance up the trail Annie shied; any horse will shy at the smell of fresh blood. Just off the path lay the beheaded body. I shuddered and passed by.<br><br>Later that same day I barely got Annie off the path before another knight passed by, this one with a squire riding behind him. The knight wore his visor, but it was just blind luck that the squire did not see us.<br><br>The next day luck turned against us.<br><br>That day for a wonder the sun shone golden through the green trees. The sunshine lifted my heart. But for years afterward I distrusted such green-gold days, as if they might mean a cruel trick of fate.<br><br>I remember how the sunlight gleamed on the black charger decked in scarlet as the knight rode up the path, as I watched him from between the trees with Annie by my side, as I kept silence, almost certain that he would pass by like the others. I remember how sun rays glistered on his hulking trunk draped in chain mail, his greaves, his gauntlets, his red-plumed helm, his visor behind which I could see only shadow. I remember how that golden light caught on his sword hilt and the device on his shield&#x2014;a red griffin rampant. I remember how it glinted on the lance his squire carried&#x2014;<br><br>I gasped. The squire was Thomas.<br><br>The knight heard my gasp and turned his head. &#x201c;Oh ho,&#x201d; he said, wheeling his charger and spurring it toward me.<br><br>I scarcely heard him or saw him, for Thomas&#x2019;s wide-eyed gaze met mine, and time had stopped for me. Thomas. His shoulders broader, his jaw harder, and a shadow in his sky blue eyes that was new to me, but still that steady regard. True Thomas.<br><br>The knight halted his steed beside me, reached down and seized me above the elbow with a grasp of steel.<br><br>Shock made me scream and struggle even before I realized what was happening. With all my small strength I strove to wrench myself free from his rough grip, glimpsing his wintery eyes through his visor. My thrashings only made him scowl. &#x201c;Stupid wench,&#x201d; he growled, tightening his fingers. &#x201c;Stop it. You&#x2019;re mine.&#x201d; Might meant right. Because he was stronger, he could take me and do what he would with me.<br><br>As if from another, kinder world I heard Thomas cry, &#x201c;Annie!&#x201d; and shout something I did not understand. Annie shrilled and reared, striking the knight full in his mailed chest with both forehooves.<br><br>She almost unseated him. Only the high cantle of his saddle kept him from toppling. He lost his grip on me, and let out a yell of anger. Off balance from pulling against him, I fell hard to the rocky ground, and there I lay with the breath knocked out of me, gawking up uselessly. I saw Thomas charging, riding low over his horse&#x2019;s neck with lance couched, spurring the steed between trees, trying to save me. I saw Annie rear again&#x2014;<br><br>The knight drew his broadsword and lopped off Annie&#x2019;s head.<br><br>Just like that, like killing a rat.<br><br>My Annie.<br><br>I saw the sword flash like a brown trout leaping, saw the spurt of vivid red&#x2014;heart&#x2019;s blood, brighter than any flower that ever bloomed. Annie&#x2019;s blood. I saw her head fly, her eyes still living and terrified for a moment as she died.<br><br>At the same time Thomas drove into the knight with the lance. But the knight wheeled, and Thomas&#x2019;s blow slipped off his breastplate. The knight bellowed, &#x201c;What! Traitor!&#x201d; and his shield struck the lance aside. With his sword already reddened by Annie&#x2019;s blood he turned on Thomas.<br><br>No. Please, no. I lurched to my feet. Thomas had no armor, no weapon, not even a leather jerkin to protect him. He threw up his arm to block the first blow and gave a shout more like a scream: &#x201c;Morgan, run!&#x201d;<br><br>I stood by Annie&#x2019;s lifeless body. I saw blood, that reddest of all reds, well from Thomas&#x2019;s arm and shoulder. The sword lifted again.<br><br>I snatched the milpreve out from under my dress; it blazed like blue fire, so bright it blinded me, so hot it burned my hand, but not as hot as the fire dragon inside me roaring, raging, rearing to smite. I shrieked, &#x201c;Death to that knight! Kill him! Kill&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The power knocked me off my feet, slammed me against an oak and drove me to the ground. I did not get to see the knight fall dead.<br><br>I awoke a few mo-ments later feeling as if his gauntleted fist had struck me down. Thomas crouched over me, clutching his wounded arm and panting with pain. Blood trickled between his fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;Thomas!&#x201d; Weak and dazed, I struggled to my knees beside him.<br><br>&#x201c;You saved my life,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;Who saved whom?&#x201d; I ripped at the frock I wore over my dress and managed to yank it off. Easing his hand aside, I started to wrap the wound, trying to stop the flow of blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Morgan,&#x201d; he murmured, and he leaned his head against my shoulder and fainted.<br><br>I piled on top of Annie&#x2019;s body anything that I could find to keep the carrion birds off her: branches, stones, the dead knight&#x2019;s shield and mail and armor.<br><br>I wrested all his warrior gear off him and left him sprawled in his woolens; the crows and ravens could have him. Let them feast on him soon; it galled me to see not a mark on him. His dead eyes staring out of his grizzled beard looked surprised, that was all. I wanted to put my heel to his cruel nose and cave his face in for hurting Thomas and killing Annie, but I didn&#x2019;t do it; I knew the memory would sicken me later, and there was already enough to sicken me.<br><br>By the time I got Annie covered, I no longer noticed that I was crying. Sobs came out of me rhythmically, just a noise like the turning of a mill wheel. I kept an eye on Thomas lying wrapped in my mantle on a patch of moss under a gigantic tree. He had a deep cut in his shoulder and a long bloody gash in his arm. I had wrapped the wounds as tightly as I could and swaddled his arm against his body so that he would not move it, then laid him there. He had not stirred or moaned, and I hoped he was still unconscious of his pain, but as I finished building my makeshift cairn over Annie, he turned his head and whispered, &#x201c;Morgan.&#x201d;<br><br>I trotted over to him and knelt beside him. He looked up at me, his blue eyes narrow and clouded. His free hand wavered toward my face.<br><br>He murmured, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry.&#x201d;<br><br>Reminded that I was crying, I could barely hold back the sobs. Tears ran down my face. Thomas whispered, &#x201c;Is it&#x2014;Ongwynn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I rubbed my face dry with my blue velvet sleeve; it was filthy and I am sure so was I. &#x201c;No, Ongwynn was well when I left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Morgause?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s with Ongwynn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But why&#x2014;why are you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hush.&#x201d; Later I would tell him why I was out here wandering the mountain, why I had gotten Annie killed, curse everything, curse Avalon and the sending that had brought me here, curse my idiocy that had made Annie lame, curse that foul knight&#x2014;I felt fiercely glad that I had killed him. But at the same time the memory of my own power chilled me.<br><br>Could I kill people anytime I wanted now?<br><br>Could I plan for this? Or did rage make me do it?<br><br>Whom would I kill next?<br><br>I shivered and brushed the thoughts aside. There was no time for thinking right now. &#x201c;We have to move,&#x201d; I told Thomas. &#x201c;Get away from here.&#x201d; Away from the path and away from the bodies.<br><br>He nodded and struggled to sit up.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;let me bring your horse first.&#x201d; I ran to where I had tethered the stolid bay nag and led it to him. He could not quite stand until I reached to help him; then he pulled himself to his feet, swaying. His blue gaze focused on my hand, still clutched in his.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hurt,&#x201d; he declared in round-eyed bewilderment, as if this could not be so. Holding my hand palm up, he stared at a raw hole seared into the flesh, a burn about the size of a walnut.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d; I had barely noticed the mark, not even to wonder what had done it to me; my hurts were not worth bothering about compared to his.<br><br>He kept hold of my hand. &#x201c;You have a sweetheart?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The&#x2014;the ring.&#x201d;<br><br>The ring woven of soft sable brown hair. &#x201c;My mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Queen Igraine! I&#x2014;I have been trying to find her. . . . He let go of me and grabbed for the nearest tree to stay upright, closing his eyes against his own weakness.<br><br>&#x201c;Thomas, no more talking.&#x201d; I snatched up my mantle from the ground. &#x201c;We have to get you on this horse. Can you put your foot in the stirrup?&#x201d;<br><br>He did, and grasped the mane with his free hand and tried to swing himself up, but could not make it. He slumped with his belly across the saddle.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay there,&#x201d; I told him.<br><br>He mumbled something. &#x201c; . . . try again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thomas, stay the way you are.&#x201d;<br><br>I chirruped at the horse and tugged the reins to get it moving.<br><br>I led it at a gentle walk&#x2014;but there is no such thing as gentle when the way leads up a wilderness mountain. Thomas was moaning by the time we had gone half a furlong. But only a little farther, I found a rocky scarp to give us shelter of sorts and, for a wonder, a trickle of water. I stopped the horse and eased Thomas off it.<br><br>He folded to the ground and gasped. &#x201c;Morgan, what are you doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Plaguing you,&#x201d; I snapped, and I threw my mantle over him, then left him for a moment while I ran back for Annie&#x2019;s packs and the knight&#x2019;s black charger.<br><br>I threw the bags over the black horse, trotted it back to Thomas, and pulled the gear off both horses, dumping their saddles and bridles and packs in a mess on the ground. Then like a badger I started rooting through the baggage. That accursed knight was well provisioned; at least we would not lack food while Thomas healed. Soup, I thought vaguely. Might there be a kettle in this muddle? Make fire, make soup. Find a soft place for Thomas, moss, leaves, bracken, find blankets, make a proper bed for him&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Morgan,&#x201d; he murmured.<br><br>I left the packs and knelt beside him. It hurt me to look at him lying so pale, so beautiful, so perilously hurt. Blue shadows lay on his tender eyelids. He did not open his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m right here,&#x201d; I told him.<br><br>&#x201c;Did he hurt you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Every part of me ached as if I had been thrashed, but my heart hurt worst. Annie. Thomas.<br><br>&#x201c;Gypsy&#x2014;pony,&#x201d; Thomas whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mane like&#x2014;lady&#x2019;s hair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Yes, I had kept Annie shining, even on the journey. My gentle Annie. I had never known it was in her to fight like that. To save me. &#x201c;Morgan, you&#x2014;you grew.&#x201d;<br><br>He was lying there with his eyes closed, talking almost in his sleep, but I became suddenly, blushingly conscious of the way the velvet gown bared my neck and clung to my breasts.<br><br>&#x201c;Hush,&#x201d; I told him, my voice not quite under control. &#x201c;Go to sleep before I take a rock to you.&#x201d; I went off to tend campfire, make soup and all the rest of it. When I felt sure Thomas was deeply sleeping, I pulled off the ragged, filthy gown, washed myself at the icy trickle of springwater, and put on one of my old brown frocks.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Thomas.<br><br>&#x201c;But I am sure I can do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;ll hurt you.&#x201d;<br><br>We sat whispering like the trees in the night, leaning against the rocks and listening to the darkness, the forest breathing, the silences and screams and hootings and wild laughter of neither of us knew what. It was our third night in that wilderness, and Thomas felt strong enough now to sit up and keep watch with me for a while. But his face showed moon pale in the light of my milpreve.<br><br>I held it on my lap, and it shone there like a blue star. I had put out the cooking fire for fear of attracting unwelcome company; the milpreve was our only light.<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t hurt me much,&#x201d; I said doubtfully. I wanted to use the milpreve to heal him. All day every day the summons of Avalon tugged like a fishhook in me, and all night every night; I paced in the dark and could not sleep. I had to travel. But I could not leave him.<br><br>&#x201c;Not much?&#x201d; he mocked gently. &#x201c;Just burn a hole in you, blacken your eyes, knock you down&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Morgan&#x2014;&#x201d; He sat forward to face me, his tone stark serious. &#x201c;That stone terrifies me. Put it away. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>I could not refuse him anything he asked of me in that way. I lifted the milpreve and let it drop inside my gown&#x2014;some whim had made me wear the sea green gown, and I had plaited my hair in a crown and wound it with ivy just for something to do. I had put a garland of ivy on Thomas too, to amuse him. But neither of us could see the other in the dark.<br><br>His voice came to me out of shadows.<br><br>&#x201c;The milpreve,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is that the reason you must go to Avalon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know who wants you there or why?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>&#x201c;Morgan?&#x201d; He could not see me.<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s the moon,&#x201d; I mumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;That fits,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Lunacy.&#x201d;<br><br>We had been through this. The first time I had mentioned the name of Avalon, it had shocked his breath away. It was a place where no one ventured, he had told me, not even warring lords, not even renegade knights. Or if knights ventured there, they came back mad and gibbering and unable to say what terror lay there, or they did not return at all. &#x201c;The moon,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;or the youngest fay, the primrose one.&#x201d;<br><br>I did not have to explain to him.<br><br>He knew of these things, as Ongwynn had said the night he had guessed her name. The Gypsies had spoken of these things around their campfires. Some folk said that the language of the Gypsies<br><br>was the language of fays and magic, the language that spoke to flowers and animals, a language that could tell a placid little dapple-gray pony to rear up and strike an armored knight.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re never likely to face a greater peril,&#x201d; whispered Thomas.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. Actually, I did not know. I did not understand then, or for years to come, how I carried my greatest peril to Avalon within my heart.<br><br>&#x201c;Morgan, do you really have to go there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. The calling in me . . .&#x201d; I could not begin to explain to him the yearning so strong it took away my fear and made me feel as if I should have been at Avalon yesterday. I murmured, &#x201c;If only there were someplace safe for you to stay ...;&#x201d;<br><br>I let the thought trail away, for I knew of no safe place in the world except Caer Ongwynn, much too far away.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Thomas, &#x201c;I will go with you.&#x201d;</p><h2>Sophie&#39;s Kiss</h2><p>This work explores the romance between Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones.

At first Cass believes these to be mere superstition, until there&#39;s a second murder, and she begins to wonder if the devil really does walk in Scalloway ...</p><p>Marsali grew up near Edinburgh, Scotland. Her summer family holidays were spent in a remote cottage in the West Highlands, the region where her detective Gavin Macrae lives. Like her sailing heroine, Cass, she has always been used to boats, and used her `gap year&#39; earnings to buy her first sailing dinghy, Lady Blue. She studied English at Dundee University, did a year of teacher training and took up her first post, teaching English and French to secondary children in Aith, Shetland. Gradually her role expanded to doing drama too, and both primary and secondary pupils have won prizes performing her plays at the local Drama Festival. Some of these plays were in Shetlandic, the local dialect. Marsali teaches dinghy sailing at her local club, and is a keen single-handed sailor in her Offshore 8 m yacht, Karima S - the double of Cass&#39;s Khalida. A qualified STGA green badge tourist guide for Shetland, she now spends a good deal of her summer sharing her home with visitors from overseas. She is particularly interested in women&#39;s history, and has published Women&#39;s Suffrage in Shetland, two years&#39; worth of original research. She followed this with The Story of Busta House, the romantic tale of the house which is the setting for part of Death on a Longship. Marsali also writes for the monthly magazine Shetland Life - a mixture of travel writing, interviews, investigative journalism and historical research.</p><h2>Red Iron Nights: A Garrett.

Lark, her mother Arlene, and Aunt Betty are in a station changing trains, leaving their lives in Harvester, Minnesota behind, and waiting for the train going to Los Angeles. Young men soldiers swarm the platform, heading off to war. Against this dramatic backdrop, <i>Gardenias</i> revisits Faith Sullivan&#x2019;s most beloved characters from <i>The Cape Ann,</i> taking them from their hometown to new lives, new dreams, and new risks. Arlene has left her husband behind after he gambled away the money she'd saved to finally build the Cape Ann house of her and Lark's Depression-era dreams. As a new life takes shape in San Diego in a wartime housing project full of neighbors they know little about, Lark wonders, as does the reader, if a dream means losing everything of value or finally finding it.</p><p>Lark Ann Erhardt, her mother, Arlene, and her aunt Betty join the thousands of people migrating to California during the 1940s war years. Her parents' marriage is in disarray, as told in Sullivan's previous novel, <i>The Cape Ann</i> (1988). Arlene and Betty are resolute in their desire to establish new lives for themselves and to find work in the war plants now desperate for workers. Nine-year-old Lark is a keen observer and patient narrator of life's twists and incongruities as she settles in to life in a San Diego housing project with the two women. Always hoping for reconciliation between her parents, Lark is confused by her circumstances but is a resilient child protective of her real and her extended family of new friends. Sullivan fills Lark's world with flawed, complex adults as well as other children. As all children do, Lark learns that some decisions and events are incomprehensible and irrevocably change one's life. Sullivan's leisurely pacing provides a quiet view into Lark's fears, hopes, and growing maturity. <i>Laurie Sundborg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I could tell something was wrong with my foot &#x2013; it wasn&#x2019;t moving right, and now I could see the broken bone sticking out of my hand. I wasn&#x2019;t in pain, but I really didn&#x2019;t want to be right here, right now &#x2013; not like this. For an awful instant I remembered my three month old son at home, my son whom I hadn&#x2019;t even seen yet. <br> No, it wasn&#x2019;t going to end like this, and I suppressed the thought. <br> Focus. Fight. Take charge.<br> "Get that gun going!" I shouted again, as I looked back under my left arm and saw the first troops come across the little footbridge. They were here. And they came running, those peace-symbol-lovin&#x2019;, foul-cussin&#x2019;, war-hatin&#x2019;, draftee American soldiers came, right into the firefight. They came right into the smack of the bullets, and the whine of the ricochets. They were called forward, and they came! God, I loved them.&#x2014;From <em>A Time to Lead</em></p></p><h2>Farmer Boy (Little House-the Laura Years)</h2><p><p>While Laura Ingalls grows up in a little house on the western prairie, Almanzo Wilder is living on a big farm in New York State. Here Almanzo and his brother and sisters help with the summer planting and fall harvest. In winter there is wood to be chopped and great slabs of ice to be cut from the river and stored. Time for fun comes when the jolly tin peddler visits, or best of all, when the fair comes to town. </p> <p>This is Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved story of how her husband Almanzo grew up as a farmer boy far from the little house where Laura lived. </p></p><p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em>. She and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. Later, Laura and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There, believing in the importance of knowing where you began in order to appreciate how far you've come, Laura wrote about her childhood growing up on the American frontier. For millions of readers Laura lives on forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.</p>The New York childhood of the young man who becomes her husband is the stuff of Laura Ingalls Wilder's FARMER BOY. With her signature insight into the daily life of a nineteenth-century farm, Wilder champions the earnest hard work and family joy of Almanzo Wilder. Details abound --the techniques for training a team of young oxen, the agony of a Saturday night bath, the myriad of delicious foods at the county fair, the unrest the "big boys" cause at school, the wisdom and guidance of parents. Wilder is a keen observer, and Cherry Jones has an eager voice. Her narration is quick paced and enthusiastic as she recounts each story with an immediacy that brings the listener into each season's happenings. Fiddle music complements the recording.

Abrams, on the occasion of The Court Arts of Indonesia Exhibition in New York, Washington, Dallas, and Los Angeles, 1990-1992. Text by Helen Ibbitson Jessup.</p><p>The Festival of Indonesia, a celebration launched this fall throughout the United States, includes several traveling art exhibitions, which have resulted in the publication of these two catalogs representing very different approaches to portraying Indonesian art. Fontein opens with three scholarly essays introducing Indonesian sculpture; the remaining two thirds of the book focuses on the exhibition's 116 works of art, providing text, picture, and bibliographic references for each. Both essays and descriptions reflect careful scholarship, and the book will long remain a standard reference title for Indonesian sculpture. Jessup devotes only 32 pages to the exhibition catalog, and since there are almost no illustrations in this part of her volume the reader is forced to refer constantly to the pictures in the narrative text. This portion never really defines what constitutes court arts in Indonesia, nor does it adequately cover their historical evolution and variation throughout the country; it is further marred by excessive use of terms in the various languages of Indonesia. While both works have sumptuous illustrations, libraries with limited budgets for art books may want to confine themselves to the Fontein volume.<br><i>- Donald Clay Johnson, Univ. of Minnesota Lib., Minneapolis</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Audubon Guide to the National Wildlife Refuges: Southeast: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, US Virgin Islands</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

Local wildlife aficionados, however, will tell you that 438,000 acres of the swamp are protected as a federal wildlife refuge, within which alligators, bobcats, black bears, and snapping turtles thrive. The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is one of more than three dozen such reserves in the southeastern United States (a region that, for the purposes of this book, includes the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico), most of them open to the public.

Molly Gloss turns her attention to the frontiers of the future, when the people of our over-polluted planet Earth voyage out to the stars to settle new worlds, to survive unknown and unpredictable hardships, and to make new human homes. Specifically, it is a story about people who have grown up on a ship that is traveling to a new world, and about the society and culture that have evolved among them by the time they arrive at their new home planet.</p></p><p>Earth is ailing, and Quakers from various countries band together for a brave mission: build a self-sustaining spaceship, and travel to the stars to find another home. <i>The Dazzle of Day</i> chronicles the lives of people who grew up on the <i>Dusty Miller</i> and lived to see it reach its destination. <p> Spiritual, steady Kristina plays the middle note in Gloss's triadic exploration of the inner lives of women; Verano begins the journey from Earth, and Vintro's story comprises the finishing notes after the journey's end. Onboard the <i>Dusty Miller</i>, a depressive malaise spreads throughout the colonists, and Kristina's daughter-in-law Juko witnesses a suicide by a co-worker while mending the ship's solar sails. Other players include Juko's son Cejo, her quiet ex-husband Humberto, and her husband Bjoro, a scientist who visits the new planet's inhospitable surface and lives to bring back reports. The colonists, who've lived their entire lives on a small climate-controlled ship, must decide whether to adjust to life on the chilly planet, prepare to terraform a section on its surface, or continue on to search for a more suitable home. </p><p> Gloss's lyrical and leisurely prose describes the lives of the spacefarers: religion and politics, quarrels and friendships, love and despisal, illness and death. At times this science fiction feels homespun as the gentle but human Quakers strive for consensus in their community during a time of wrenching change.</p><p><b>Molly Gloss</b> has won the Whiting Writer's Award and the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award.

These are the memoirs of the great mystic and teacher who inspired a generation of disciples and followers before, during and briefing after the Second World War. In Meetings With Remarkable Men Gurdjieff introduces us to some of the companions he encountered in his travels to the most remote regions of Central Asia. With colorful episodes from his adventures, he brings to life the story of his own relentless search for a real and universal knowledge. The book can be read as a colorful narrative or psychological autobiography, but the meaning of its contents can be better appreciated in relation to the expositions of his previously published ideas.</p><p>Right around the turn of the 20th century, G.I. Gurdjieff initiated a group of spiritual adventurers called the "Seekers of Truth." These intrepid intellectuals of every stripe crisscrossed Africa and Asia in search of the hidden mysteries of antiquity. In <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men</i>, Gurdjieff narrates their exploits while drawing portraits of these extraordinary figures (including one woman and a dog). Half travel journal, half autobiography, <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men</i> begins with Gurdieff's childhood, when he finds his book learning at odds with paranormal events that were self-evident but inexplicable through modern science. Later he discovers a map of "pre-sands Egypt" and evidence of the Sarmound Brotherhood, alleged keepers of ancient wisdom dating back four and a half millennia. He climbs the Himalayas, follows the Nile, and is led blindfolded to a mysterious monastery. In his encounters with dervishes, monks, and fakirs, Gurdjieff recovers the wisdom he seeks; by comparison, European understanding, he says, is backwards and barbaric. A controversial figure in his time, Gurdjieff inspired deep love and loyalty in his pupils and ridicule from skeptics. At the bookends of <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men</i>, Gurdjieff suggests the value of blurring the line between allegory and straight reporting. But then what exactly is <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men</i>? You be the judge. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><b>G. I. Gurdjieff</b> was born in 1887 in Alexandropol. After studying with spiritual masters in the Near East and Asia, he founded the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in France.</p><h2>Therapeutic Breathing Exercise (English and Chinese Edition)</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Text: English, Chinese (translation)</p><h2>Sportswriter: The Life and Times of Grantland Rice</h2><p>"Grantland Rice was the greatest man I have known," Red Smith once wrote. "The greatest talent, the greatest gentleman." Most of Rice's contemporaries would have shared this assessment. One of the most celebrated sportswriters of all time, it was Grantland Rice who immortalized Notre Dame's outstanding 1924 backfield as "The Four Horsemen," who nicknamed Red Grange "The Galloping Ghost," and who authored one of the most frequently quoted poetic couplets in all of sport: "For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, / He writes--not that you won or lost--but how you played the Game." But more important, if we see the 1920s and 1930s--the era of Jack Dempsey and Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones--as a Golden Age of Sport, it is in large part because Grant Rice saw them as golden, and conveyed this golden vision to millions of readers daily.<br> In <em>Sportswriter</em>, Charles Fountain provides the first full-length biography of Grantland Rice. This colorful, vividly narrated portrait ranges from Rice's childhood in Nashville, to his days as star athlete at Vanderbilt, to his first jobs in Atlanta, Nashville, and New York, to his prime as the most popular, most read sportswriter of his day, the dean of a remarkable group of 1920s writers that included Heywood Broun, Damon Runyon, Paul Gallico, and Ring Lardner. Fountain provides unforgettable portraits of Rice's extraordinarily wide range of friends, from cartoonist Rube Goldberg and columnist Franklin P. Adams, to sports legends Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, and Bobby Jones, to his closest friend, Ring Lardner, a man who was in many ways his opposite. We learn of Rice's staggering accomplishments as sportswriter, which included writing a column that appeared six days a week in over a hundred newspapers, selecting an All-America Football Team that was <em>the</em> All-America team for more than 20 years, editing <em>The American Golfer</em>, the leading golf magazine for over a decade, producing and narrating numerous film shorts, and in general publishing some 67 million words over a 53 year career. And as Fountain tells this story, he also provides memorable snapshots of American life: the small-town baseball teams at the turn of the century, the bustling newspaper world of New York City (at a time when there were 14 daily papers in New York, twelve on and around Park Row), and most of all, some of the great sporting events of all time, including the Dempsey-Willard heavyweight bout, the 1919 Black Sox World Series scandal, Bobby Jones's Grand Slam, and much more.<br> Here then is the colorful life and times of a man who loved sports--who loved the contests, loved the atmosphere, loved the camaraderie of the press box and of a passenger-train drawing room--and who loved sharing it all with the millions who read his work.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Charles Fountain</strong> is Assistant Professor of Journalism at Northeastern University. A contributor to magazines and newspapers such as <em>The Boston Globe</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>, he is the author of <em>Another Man's Poison: The Life and Writing of Columnist George Frazier</em>.<br>As Fountain (Journalism/Northeastern) admits in this fine biography, Grantland Rice's ``florid style'' and ``saccharin rhyme...would doom him to deserved obscurity'' today. But in the 1920's and 30's, Rice was the most important and widely read sportswriter in America. Following the 1924 Army-Notre Dame game at the Polo Grounds, Rice penned what Fountain calls ``the most famous lead in sports journalism history''--``Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again''--and immortalized the Irish backfield of Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. Rice's knack for the golden phrase went back to his early days in Nashville: ``The One Great Scorer...marks/not that you won or lost/but how you played the Game.'' Verse headed almost every column and story from Rice's first job at his hometown Nashville Daily News, where he made $5 a week, to his heyday with the New York Tribune, where, in 1925, he earned an unheard-of $1,000 a week. With his syndicated column, his association with Collier's magazine, his Sportlight Films productions, and his radio work, the ``dean'' of sports journalism became as much a celebrity as the men he immortalized. Finding ``nobility and gentility'' in his subject, Fountain notes that Rice embodied the ``gee whiz'' school of sportswriting as opposed to the ``aw nuts'' school of Damon Runyon and Ring Lardner. Fountain owns up to Rice's ``glib insensitivity and ignorance'' on matters of race, however, admitting that Rice was as derogatory of Jess Willard and Joe Louis as any other sportswriter, and that he only grudgingly gave Jesse Owens his due. But Rice's 67 million words of ``purple prose'' over a 53-year career played no small part, he emphasizes, in casting the aura of legend around the likes of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Bobby Jones, and Red Grange. A solid effort that uses ample quotes and examples from Rice's work, providing insight into the man and his times. (Eighteen halftones--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Days and nights he and his team&#x2014;his brothers&#x2014;would venture forth in heavily armed convoys from their Forward Operating Base to engage in the nerve-racking yet strangely exhilarating work of either disarming the deadly improvised explosive devices that had been discovered, or picking up the pieces when the alert came too late. They relied on an army of remote-controlled cameras and robots, but if that technology failed, a technician would have to don the eighty-pound Kevlar suit, take the Long Walk up to the bomb, and disarm it by hand. This lethal game of cat and mouse was, and continues to be, the real war within America&#x2019;s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br>But <i>The Long Walk</i> is not just about battle itself. It is also an unflinching portrayal of the toll war exacts on the men and women who are fighting it. When Castner returned home to his wife and family, he began a struggle with a no less insidious foe, an unshakable feeling of fear and confusion and survivor&#x2019;s guilt that he terms The Crazy. His thrilling, heartbreaking, stunningly honest book immerses the reader in two harrowing and simultaneous realities: the terror and excitement and camaraderie of combat, and the lonely battle against the enemy within&#x2014;the haunting memories that will not fade, the survival instincts that will not switch off. After enduring what he has endured, can there ever again be such a thing as &#x201c;normal&#x201d;? <i>The Long Walk</i> will hook you from the very first sentence, and it will stay with you long after its final gripping page has been turned.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012</strong>: To those trained in Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the last-resort tactic for defusing bombs is known as the Long Walk: a soldier dealing with the device up close, alone, with no margin for error. <i>The Long Walk</i> is Brian Castner's tale of two wars. He fought the first in Iraq, serving two tours dismantling roadside bombs before they exploded, or wading through the grisly carnage of unchecked detonations. The second battle began when he returned home, his life exploding as he stepped from a curb into what he calls the Crazy: a consuming froth of panic and undiagnosed pain that alienated him from his family and compelled him to rig his minivan with ammunition clips for faster reloads while driving through suburbia. With its tense and claustrophobic portraits of the violent streets of Kirkuk, Castner's account is a dead-on description of modern warfare in an unfamiliar land. But it also offers sober insight into the stresses of war on the human body and mind (the effects of blast waves on soft tissues--especially in the brain--are chilling), destruction wrought on those left behind, and the long, lonely walk home. <i>--Jon Foro</i>BRIAN CASTNER, a graduate of Marquette University with an electrical engineering degree, served three tours in the Middle East as an officer of the U.S. Air Force&#x2014;two of them as the head of an EOD team in Iraq. In 2006, he received a Bronze Star for his service. Upon returning to the United States following his service, he consulted as a independent civilian contractor, training military EOD units on tactical bomb-disposal procedures prior to their deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. He lives in Buffalo, New York, with his wife and children.</p><h2>The Pale of Settlement: Stories</h2><p><p>In settings from Jerusalem to Manhattan, from the archaeological ruins of the Galilee to Kathmandu, <i>The Pale of Settlement</i> gives us characters who struggle to piece together the history and myths of their family&#x2019;s past.</p><p>This collection of linked short stories takes its title from the name of the western border region of the Russian empire within which Jews were required to live during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

And in the haunting title story, bedtime tales are set against acts of terrorism and memories of a love beyond reach. The stories of <i>The Pale of Settlement</i> explore the borderland between Israelis and American Jews, emigrants and expatriates, and vanished homelands and the dangerous world in which we live today.</p></p><p>MARGOT SINGER is also the author of a novel, <i>Underground Fugue</i>.

Is the body found in the lake, under the unseeing gaze of the Bethesda angel, the first victim of a deranged psychopath, or is the case connected to other missing girls and women in years past whose remains have never been found? Just as the trio gets their first lead, the investigation is almost derailed when Mike and Alex become embroiled in a scandal.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Alex attempts to fight the accusations leveled against her and Mike, she follows clues that range from the park&#x2019;s most buried &#x2014; literally &#x2014; secrets all the way to the majestic Dakota, which has experienced its own share of tragedies. When another young woman is attacked in the park, a new question arises: is this enormous urban park a sanctuary&#x2014;as it seems to the thousands of New Yorkers and tourists who fill it every day&#x2014;or is it a hunting ground for a killer with a twisted mind?<br><br>Once again, Linda Fairstein will thrill both longtime fans and new readers with an explosive page-turner filled with a shocking realism that only she can deliver.</p><p><b>LINDA&nbsp;FAIRSTEIN</b>&nbsp;was chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades and is America&#x2019;s foremost legal expert on sexual assault and domestic violence.

Ray Peterson, the man in charge of Manhattan North Homicide, either couldn&#x2019;t hear me shouting because of the distance or wasn&#x2019;t interested in what I had to say.</p><p>I swiveled and backtracked up the broad staircase, hoping to overtake the crew carrying the corpse to the roadway on the 72nd Street transverse. But they had already reached the open doors of the transport vehicle by the time I hit the pavement and was stopped by uniformed cops who were stringing yellow crime scene tape across the gaping space between the elegant balustrades.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Jack.&#x201d; After more than twelve years as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney&#x2019;s Office, I knew the morgue attendants almost as well as I knew my doormen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Alex Cooper. Give me three minutes with her, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack picked his head up and turned toward me just as one of the officers brushed my hand off the tape. &#x201c;In or out, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; the cop growled. &#x201c;You want to ride with the body, that&#x2019;s fine. But you don&#x2019;t get back in here once you walk past this point.&#x201d;</p><p>I needed to talk to the lieutenant and be briefed on the findings along with Mercer, but I also wanted to see the girl whose remains had been found splayed beneath the northern abutment of Bow Bridge early this morning. I wanted to know what she looked like now, before her flesh met the cold instruments of the autopsy room.</p><p>Jack called out over the back of the young cop who was restraining me. &#x201c;No can do, Alex. It&#x2019;s already a madhouse here between the regulars and the press scavengers. Feel free to drop by my office later on. She won&#x2019;t be on the table until tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>It was only 7:45, but it was obvious that police officers from all over the city were being bused in from their commands to form a perimeter around the roadways that led to the Terrace and the Lake, which was the very centerpiece of the Park. There was nothing more difficult to secure than a crime scene that had no obvious boundaries, in the middle of the most trafficked public space on the planet.</p><p>Mercer Wallace, a first-grade detective with the Special Victims Unit and one of my best friends, had picked me up at my home just a few blocks from the Park entrance. We had passed trucks from every major media outlet and watched as reporters and camera crews sneaked through the dense spring growth of bushes and plantings to get closer to the vista where death had intruded on this glorious spring morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Alexandra, we&#x2019;re waiting on you.&#x201d; Mercer was shouting at me from beside the fountain at the foot of the steps.</p><p>I waved at him to let him know I&#x2019;d heard him, then watched the van drive off before retracing my way down toward the Lake. I&#x2019;d left the stern cop manning the tape barrier with more pushy onlookers to contend with than me. It was too early for the thousands of tourists who would flood the Park later on this June day, but the daily complement of joggers, power walkers, bikers, dog owners, Rollerbladers, and wildlife aficionados all seemed to be stopped in their tracks, trying to figure out the cause of the commotion below.</p><p>This time I took the two-tiered staircase&#x2014;the eastern one&#x2014; more slowly than my first descent minutes ago. I looked around at the stunning landscape and the water of the calm Lake sparkling with morning sunlight, but my eyes darted from tree to tree as figures&#x2014;some in blue uniforms but mostly civilians in exercise gear&#x2014;appeared on every path and in each leafy opening, like characters in a fast-moving video game. I wondered if the killer or killers were among them.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be looking for your perp, Alexandra,&#x201d; Mercer said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s long gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>I joined up with him, and we continued on to the huddle of detectives clustered around the lieutenant. I recognized most of them from cases we had worked together&#x2014;they greeted me by name&#x2014;while those I hadn&#x2019;t met before acknowledged my presence with a &#x201c;Good morning, counselor,&#x201d; the arm&#x2019;s-length term for a prosecutor&#x2014;especially when she or he was treading on NYPD turf.</p><p>Mercer finished his thought. &#x201c;&#x2019;Cause she&#x2019;s been dead for weeks. Just washed up today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Johnny Mayes was here before we arrived.&#x201d;</p><p>Mayes was a brilliant young forensic pathologist. I nodded, understanding how well he knew his business.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for coming over, Alex,&#x201d; the lieutenant said while he put out his cigarette against the side of the fountain before placing the stub in the pocket of his tattered brown jacket. No need to leave his DNA in saliva on a butt that would be picked up by Crime Scene investigators who were already scouring both sides of the shoreline for clues. &#x201c;I wanted you to eyeball the kid before we moved her, but the paparazzi with the long-distance lenses were scrambling through the brush here. Had to whisk her the hell out before they grabbed one of the rowboats for a close-up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it, Loo. I&#x2019;m here for whatever you need.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d been the prosecutor in charge of the Special Victims Unit for almost ten years. Our office had long had a system of assistant DAs &#x201c;riding&#x201d; homicides and major felonies&#x2014;going out on calls with detectives 24/7&#x2014;to try to make the legal piece of every valid case hold up in court. We went to crime scenes and station houses, hospitals and morgues&#x2014;taking statements from suspects and witnesses, overseeing lineups, drafting search warrants, and generally lending our expertise on all matters likely to result in an arrest.</p><p>My specialty was a late entry in the field of criminal law. Sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, sex trafficking, and homicides related to these acts had been ignored by our justice system since American courts were created. But our office had lobbied for legislative reform and pioneered techniques to allow these victims&#x2014; too long without voices&#x2014;to begin to triumph in the courtroom in the late &#x2019;70s and early &#x2019;80s, a period when violent crime threatened to devour the island of Manhattan.</p><p>Lieutenant Peterson had already lit his next cigarette. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know what we need yet. Don&#x2019;t know much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What else did Dr. Mayes say?&#x201d;</p><p>Peterson started to walk along the path that led from the fountain toward Bow Bridge, which arched over the Lake to the Ramble. He repeated to me what he had probably just told Mercer, who was a step or two behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;Doc says he doubted she was even twenty years old.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No ID on her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty hard to carry your driver&#x2019;s license when you&#x2019;re naked, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>I could see five men on the far side of the bridge&#x2014;detectives, no doubt&#x2014;all of them wearing booties and vinyl gloves. Four were standing at the water&#x2019;s edge, while one was crouching directly beneath the stone archway, his toes about to disappear in the water.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that Mike?&#x201d; I asked the lieutenant. His thick head of black hair was a giveaway, even at this distance, confirmed by his trademark navy blazer.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. A rookie from the Central Park precinct caught the squeal. Mike was working a day tour, so I assigned the case to him.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike Chapman had come on the job shortly before I graduated from law school and joined the DA&#x2019;s office. He and Mercer had partnered together on many of the worst cases imaginable, remaining close friends after Mercer transferred to SVU, preferring to work with victims who survived their attacks.</p><p>The three of us started across the span, a familiar image in countless Park photographs featuring boaters and ice skaters. I couldn&#x2019;t help but look down at the water, as though some clue was about to float by just in time for me to spot it.</p><p>Mike ducked out and stepped back to talk to the other guys from the squad. I could see him shaking his head. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed our approach.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything, Mike?&#x201d; Peterson called out.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, Loo,&#x201d; Mike shouted over his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s your minder, Chapman,&#x201d; Freddie Figueroa said, laughing as he pointed at me. My relationship with Mike was a source of great amusement to many of our colleagues, who couldn&#x2019;t figure how I tolerated his constant needling yet knew he&#x2019;d covered my back in more situations than I could count. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better come up with something fast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Coop,&#x201d; Mike said, flashing all one hundred megawatts of his best grin. &#x201c;Hope you brought a crystal ball. This one will take more than your brains.&#x201d;</p><p>I started to walk to the end of the bridge, but he called me off.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay there. Last thing we need is another pair of footprints in the mud. Did you see my girl?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;Jack was ready to roll. The locals were about to surround him, so he took off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hal&#x2019;s got plenty of close-ups if you want to take a look.&#x201d;</p><p>Hal Sherman, one of the masters of crime scene investigations, came up behind me. He&#x2019;d been photographing each of the approaches to the Lake, on the theory that no one would know what angles were important until we had a sense of what had happened to this victim and where.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Alex. Too quiet too long, huh?&#x201d; Hal said, patting me on the back before he reached for his notepad. &#x201c;That statue on top of the fountain, any idea what she&#x2019;s called?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked across at the colossal bronze figure of a woman, raised high above the plaza and held aloft by four cherubs, with wings outstretched as she delivered her blessing over the Lake below.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, Hal,&#x201d; I said as he scratched the answer on a notepad. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the most iconic statue in the Park. She&#x2019;s called the Angel of the Waters.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike Chapman joined us on the bridge, pulling off his gloves and stuffing them in his rear pants pocket. &#x201c;That name worked for her once upon a time, Coop. Now she stands up there with the best vantage point of all, sees everything that goes on here, but gives us nothing. I&#x2019;d like to know everything that <i>she</i> knows.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even eight o&#x2019;clock, and you&#x2019;re loaded for bear. Why take it out on an angel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the first body I&#x2019;ve had in this Lake, Coop. We&#x2019;ve got two cold cases&#x2014;young women who have never been identified whose files are collecting dust in the squad room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How old are those runs that I don&#x2019;t even know about them?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Are you figuring this one falls into some kind of pattern with the others?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just thinking that statue may be an attractive nuisance. Maybe she blessed the waters a century ago, but now she&#x2019;s a magnet for murder. She&#x2019;s an angel, all right,&#x201d; Mike said, staring at the beautiful sunlit figure that towered over us. &#x201c;A death angel.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Words of Westernesse: Tolkien&#39;s Languages of Men and Hobbits</h2><p>This book compiles the updated and illustrated essays on grammar and vocabulary of Ad�naic and Westron that one author of Codex Regius had previously published on Lalaith's Middle-earth Science Pages. <br>Lovers of J.R.R.Tolkien's invented languages have mostly disregarded the tongues spoken by the men of N�menor and Middle-earth. The known vocabulary is small in comparison to the much better documented languages of the Elves, the grammar is only rudimentary described and relationships between words are difficult to identify. Yet it is possible to enjoy J.R.R. Tolkien's creativity in the 'lesser' languages of Middle-earth as well. This book takes a light-hearted view on the grammar, analyses the 'Lament of Atalant�', the only poem Tolkien has written in the language of the sunken island of N�menor, and tries to reconstruct the development of the words used by men (and hobbits!) of Middle-earth from the Second to the Third Age under the sun.</p><p><i>Codex Regius</i> is a pseudonym and label of a pair of two authors from Slove�nia and Germany, respectively. One author is a university engineer of chemistry and, before both set up a freelance trans�lation business, has spent her time trying to convey the wonders of the Peri�odic Table to mostly unreceptive students. The other is a graduate of phys�ical engineering and former technical editor. Both are working from home, which the children find very convenient when they come from school. The two authors of <i>Codex Regius</i> are married to each other and still trying to find a common language.</p><h2>The Yage Letters: Redux (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>In January 1953, William S. Burroughs began an expedition into the jungles of South America to find <i>yage</i>, the fabled hallucinogen of the Amazon. From the notebooks he kept and the letters he wrote home to Allen Ginsberg, Burroughs composed a narrative of his adventures that later appeared as <i>The Yage Letters</i>. For this edition, Oliver Harris has gone back to the original manuscripts and untangled the history of the text, telling the fascinating story of its genesis and cultural importance. Also included in this edition are extensive materials, never before published, by both Burroughs and Ginsberg.</p><p><b>William S. Burroughs </b>is widely recognized as one of the most influential and innovative writers of the twentieth century. His books include <i>Junky</i>, <i>Naked Lunch</i>, and <i>The Wild Boys</i>.</p></p><p>William Burroughs (1915-1997) is widely reconized as one of the most innovative writers of the twentieth century. His books include: Junky, Naked Lunch, The Soft Machine, and Cities of the Red Night. Allen Ginsberg is also the author of Howl and Other Poems, which was originally published by City Lights Books in the fall of 1956. Oliver Harris is a professor in Literature and Film in the School of American Studies at Keele University, he is the editor of The Letters of William S. Burroughs (Penguin) and the 50th anniversary definitive edition of Junky (Penguin).This epistolary novel, first published in 1963, is actually a fascinating travel log written mostly by Burroughs of a trip he made to Peru and Colombia in 1953 to track down the legendary yage vine (also called <i>ayahuasca</i>), valued among the Indians for its telepathic and anesthetic powers. After a padding of manuscript history from scholar Oliver Harris (<i>The Letters of William S. Burroughs</i>), we find Burroughs writing to Ginsberg, recording his mostly harrowing, occasionally enlightening experiments with the drug, as well as his experiences picking up stray boys and eluding nosy officials. The second half of the book, dated seven years later, contains letters and poems from Ginsberg to Burroughs from the same region and, in turn, record Ginsberg's more intensely spiritual trips ("visit the moon, see the dead, see God"). When not violently poisoned by the drug, Burroughs attained wild, beautifully rendered hallucinations of the "Composite City," and his reflections on the corruption of government and the insidious spread of disease prove haunting and masterly. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whether his fictions are set centuries past or close to the present, Akutagawa was a modernist, writing in polished, superbly nuanced prose subtly exposing human needs and flaws. "In a Grove," which was the basis for Kurosawa's classic film <em>Rashomon</em>, tells the chilling story of the killing of a samurai through the testimony of witnesses, including the spirit of the murdered man. The fable-like "Yam Gruel" is an account of desire and humiliation, but one in which the reader's sympathy is thoroughly unsettled. And in "The Martyr," a beloved orphan raised by Jesuit priests is exiled when he refuses to admit that he made a local girl pregnant. He regains their love and respect only at the price of his life. All six tales in the collection show Akutagawa as a master storyteller and an exciting voice of modern Japanese literature.</p><p>Rashomon-An atmosphere of decadence in early Kyoto.

Award-winning <i>Cattle Kingdom</i> provides readers with all the colourful tales of raffish characters, political intrigues and partnerships, fortunes made and lost, and the harsh realities of prairie winters. The era also gave us the mythic figure of the cowboy, still prominent in Alberta today.</p> <p>Nowhere is the story of ranching more rich and varied than in Alberta. There was an assortment of high rollers, big-money men from the east, English lords and remittance men, along with refugees from the American west and ordinary folk seeking a homestead and a new dream. The newly formed North West Mounted Police was on hand as well. Famous ranches were created during this period, including the Cochrane, the Oxley and the North West Cattle Company (Bar U). The cast of characters included John Ware; the brave and foolhardy Major-General Thomas Bland Strange, who had plans for a ranch for retired British army types; and the scrappy Pat Burns, who parlayed a small slaughterhouse in Calgary into a giant meat-packing and cattle empire.</p> <p>By the time of the first Calgary Stampede in 1912, the cattle kingdom was on the wane. More and more settlers arrived and began fencing and farming the once limitless grazing lands. And then came the discovery of oil. But during its brief and brilliant season in the sun, early ranching in Alberta put an indelible stamp on the history and culture of the Canadian west.</p></p><p><p><b>Edward Brado</b>, a native of Alberta, has published many geographical and historical articles in major daily newspapers and periodicals such as <i>Canadian Geographic</i>, <i>Western Living</i> and <i>Alberta Magazine</i>.

He lives in Minnesota with his wife and two children.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Though they're reminiscent of Edward Packard's "Choose Your Own Adventure" series (Bantam), these books take the concept to a new level. Readers not only take an active role by choosing the outcome of a quest, but also learn some history. Each book begins with background information. Doeden's narrative takes place in feudal Japan, during the Age of the Warring States, 1467&#x2013;1600. The fighters, who were skilled in the art of <i>ninjutsu</i> and experts in the use of weapons such as <i>katanas</i> and <i>shuriken</i>, could be hired as assassins, mercenaries, or bodyguards, roles that are included in the story choices. Hanel describes the steps to becoming a knight and life in medieval times; vivid portrayals of siege tactics and battles place readers in the time period. Although the focus is on knighthood, the details of peasants' travails create a well-rounded presentation. Colorful reproductions, computer-generated illustrations, and some photographs of weapons help to transport children to these times and places. Reluctant readers will be especially drawn to these books, though other children will find them engaging as well.&#x2014;<i>Lana Miles, Jackson Elementary School, Rosenberg, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The words are glossed and there is a quotation illustrating the word in context. They have also collected into panels words of particular kinds (Shakespeare&#39;s bawdy for example). The book includes a unique series of diagrammatical representations of the relationships between characters and places for each play.</p><p>David Crystal is one of the most authoritative commentators on the English language. He is the author of the best-selling &#39;The English Language&#39; and the editor of the &#39;Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language&#39;. He lives in Anglesey, Wales. Ben Crystal, David&#39;s son, is an actor and lives in London (NW1). Stanley Wells is General Editor of the Oxford Shakespeare and Associate Editor of the New Penguin Shakespeare series.The main lexical references for Shakespeare scholars in the twentieth century were first Alexander Schmidt's two-volume <i>Shakespeare Lexicon</i> (1874) and later C. T. Onions' <i>Shakespeare Glossary,</i> which appeared in 1911 and was revised by Onions in 1919. A further revision in 1986, by Robert D. Eagleson, kept Onions in print but failed, to some extent, to satisfy scholars. The new <i>Shakespeare's Words</i> seems likely to fill the void created by the superannuated Onions.<p>Using the <i>New Penguin Shakespeare</i> as their text, the editors, linguist David Crystal and his actor son Ben Crystal, first collected all of the "problem" words flagged by the Penguin editors and then scoured the plays and sonnets for additional "difficult" words--especially words that are no longer current or that have developed a different sense since Shakespeare's time. After a few further additions, their entries totaled 21,263 under 13,626 headwords.</p><p>Rather than defining a word by listing a single near synonym, the Crystals decided that a system called lexical triangulation would better reflect the complexity of Shakespeare's language. Most entries have three glosses, each providing a slightly different slant. For example, <i>englut</i> is glossed as "swallow up, gulp down, devour." Each entry includes part of speech, an illustrative quotation (with text and context identified), and selected references to other occurrences. Sidebars contain brief tutorials on address forms, money, weapons, and more. </p><p>Readers newly acquainted with Shakespeare will benefit greatly by browsing through the Crystals' list of 100 frequently encountered words, which are accompanied by more illustrative quotations than are provided elsewhere. Other useful features are a chronology, plot synopses, diagrams illustrating interactions of characters, and 16 appendixes providing brief definitions for historical people, places, foreign terms, and other vocabulary not found in the <i>A-Z</i> section.</p><p>This is a most ambitious work that will be of immense value to student and scholar alike, a worthy successor to the landmark volumes that preceded it.

The targets in the first instance were banks and in the second, prisons. Unarguably America&#x2019;s most famous bank robber, Willie never injured a soul, but took on almost a hundred banks and departed three of America&#x2019;s most escape-proof penitentiaries. This is the stuff of myth&#x2014;rascally and cautionary by turns&#x2014;yet true in every searing, diverting, and brilliantly recalled detail.</p><p><p>WILLIE SUTTON was named by the FBI as one of their Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in 1950. He died a free man in Spring Hill, Florida, at the age of seventy-nine.</p>Irishtown Made Me<br>I was born on June 30, 1901, on the corner of Nassau and Gold in a section along the Brooklyn docks known as Irishtown. When I was three, we moved over one block to High Street, between Gold Street and Bridge Street, and about five years later we moved down the block from 183 High to 227 High. Irishtown was wedged in between the East River on the north, the Navy Yard on the east, and the Washington Street entrance approach to the Brooklyn Bridge off to the west. To pin my own neighborhood down more closely, the Manhattan Bridge was built while I was nine or ten and we kids used to drive everybody crazy by clambering up the structural ironwork which was going up only a block away from my house.<br><br>It was a workingman's neighborhood of one- and two-family dwellings and small neighborhood stores in which credit was extended from payday to payday. We weren't bad off, considering. My father, William Francis Sutton, Sr.--I'm William Francis, Jr.--was a hard-working blacksmith who earned fifteen dollars a week, which was not a bad salary in those days. A blacksmith at that time was like an automobile mechanic today. No matter how bad the times got, there was always a place somewhere for a good one. My mother's father, who was totally blind, lived with us, and so did her brothers, John and Jim, plus John's wife, my Aunt Alice. My grandfather had gone blind from working over the coffee roasters for the A &amp; P stores, and he had a pension. The others all worked and contributed to the upkeep of the house. We were the first family in the neighborhood to have a Victrola, a brand-new Victor in which the music was produced from round cylinders and projected through a cone-shaped horn.<br><br>It was a tough neighborhood, but it was a toughness without any strut or swagger. There was constant warfare for control of the docks, because to control the docks meant that you controlled the gambling, the loan-sharking, the pilfering, and the kickbacks. Plus the loading racket, which was the sweetest racket of all. Two rackets really. A flat rate, otherwise known as extortion, was levied against the importer, and then another charge was levied against the truckers for every crate they loaded. Lead pipes and brass knuckles were standard equipment. Murder was commonplace. No one was ever convicted. A code of silence was observed in Irishtown more faithfully than omerts is observed by the Mafia.<br><br>A code of silence that was to have a powerful influence on my life.<br><br>Since it was all muscle, the gang members were generally in their late teens or early twenties and therefore very easy for a kid to identify with. The dock boss--the leader--would usually be a little older, all the way up into his mid-twenties, maybe. They gained control by killing their predecessors, and they in turn were killed by their successors. Two years was a long time for a dock boss to stay alive; the turnover was very rapid. They were beaten to a pulp on a dark street; they were shot or stabbed and dumped into the water.<br><br>Bill Lovert, my first idol, held power longer than most. A slim man, not very tall, with a sure sense of command and a vibrant personality. Or, at any rate, he was before he had his head bashed in along the docks one night. His successor, Dinny Meehan, was the only dock boss I can remember who died in bed. By which I mean that somebody slipped in through his bedroom window while he was asleep and put a bullet in his brain.<br><br>It wasn't only the gangs that were at war with the police. Everybody was. If a man was arrested, his whole family would run alongside the paddy wagon screaming:<br><br>"Stop beating my husband!"<br><br>"Stop beating my son!"<br><br>"They're murdering my daddy!"<br><br>The word would go out and in a matter of minutes all his friends would gather outside the police headquarters at Poplar Street and set up a clamor:<br><br>"Murderers! Cowards! Leave the lad alone!"<br><br>The lad was going to be beaten up anyway. Everybody knew that. The theory was that if you could show the police that there were people on the outside who were interested in his welfare the beating would be less severe.<br><br>Either way, all the police ever got out of him was the exercise. Nobody ever talked in Irishtown.<br><br>The Italian section began on the other side of the Tillary Street Slaughterhouse, and as far as the kids were concerned we got along very nicely. Probably, now that I think of it, because PS 5 was situated right on the border, and neither group had to fight its way through. The Irish mobs and the Italian mobs were something else. The Irish, having got there first, ran the docks, and the Italians were always fighting for their piece of the action. They didn't get very far. Scarface Al Capone was a member of the Italian mob, and it was common knowledge in later years that he had gone to Chicago because the Irish mob played too rough. Although there was one occasion I distinctly remember where the Irish mob invaded an Italian social club down at Union Street and Fourth Avenue in South Brooklyn, and several of the Irish were brought back dead.<br>If the docks were a battleground, the East River was both our playground and our lifeline. We swam through the raw untreated garbage which was dumped regularly into the river. We dove off the cargo barges as they were being pulled toward shore, against the tide, by their little tugboats. Before I was out of my early teens I was swimming to Manhattan and back with such ease that on three separate occasions I was able to rescue friends of mine who couldn't make it. If I hadn't been such a powerful swimmer in my youth I would never have been able to save myself, years later, when an attempt to escape from a Pennsylvania prison through the main sewer went all wrong.<br><br>Everything came in by barge, including the livestock that was headed for the Tillary Street Slaughterhouse. A cattle drive through the narrow cobblestone streets of Irishtown? I saw it often. The barges, carrying cattle or sheep, would dock a couple of blocks from St. Ann's, the first school I attended. The cattle would be driven down Hudson Avenue, past the tenement houses and the neighborhood stores, to the slaughterhouse, which was actually on Hudson Avenue, a little east of Tillary, a block away from PS 5, the second school I attended. The sheep didn't have to be driven. They would follow the Judas sheep, which, at this slaughterhouse anyway, was literally a black sheep. Two big iron doors would swing open and the sheep, baaing piteously, would be crowded into the building.<br><br>The slaughtering was done in open view on what could be compared to the loading platform of a factory. And it was slaughter on an assembly line. One of the workers would hit the cattle on the head with a sledgehammer to knock him off his feet and stun him and another would immediately slit his throat. With the sheep, they would simply run a long knife through the throat. The workers would be standing there in hip boots on a floor that was awash with blood, and every now and then one of them would stop to scoop up a cupful of the warm blood and drink it down. They were big, powerful men, and they believed that it gave them extra strength. That's what they told me, anyway. A couple of times while I was standing there watching, they even offered me a cup. I didn't like the taste of it much, but since I was never a kid to turn down a challenge I'd drink it.<br><br>I had nothing against the workers. They were German immigrants, most of them, with heavy accents. A job was a job. But that Judas sheep, I came to hate it. I swear that he knew what he was doing. There was an expression of exaggerated innocence on its face that no other sheep had. I hated it so much that I got all of my friends together and planned to drown it when the next load of sheep arrived. After the gangplank of the barge had been lowered we came running forward, swinging sticks and throwing rocks, and drove the black sheep right into the river. It had never occurred to any of us that the other sheep were going to follow it right into the river. What a mess!<br><br>I have never forgotten the Judas sheep, though. Or ever stopped hating it. How could I? I kept seeing that same expression of exaggerated innocence in the faces of the hired killers, the woman stranglers, and the sex fiends I ran across in prison.<br>We were not a family that ever had any trouble with the police. Nobody before me. And nobody except me. My mother was a deeply religious woman who filled the house with religious paintings and artifacts and was always stuffing rosary beads and religious medals into my pockets. We were regular churchgoers, and my brother, Jimmy, who was 15 months older than me, and my sister Helen remained very active in religious affairs all of their lives.<br><br>Over all of us hung the memory of the family tragedy, the death of my little sister Agnes. Agnes had been one year younger than me, a beautiful little girl with a headful of curls, the darling of the family. Such an outstanding little beauty that people were always commenting on it. When she was seven years old, she fell off the stoop in front of the house, split the back of her head open, and contracted meningitis.<br><br>Two or three days, that's all it took. She died there in the house. In those days in that neighborhood, our people didn't trust the hospitals. Any more than they trusted anything else that smacked of officialdom. People went into the hospital and died, that's all they knew. "The Bellevue Disease," they would say with a shudder. And then cross themselves. "The Black Bottle," they'd whisper knowingly. For it was common gossip in my neighborhood that if they happened to need a bed or something at Bellevue, they would pick out a poor Irish patient and give him the Black Bottle. Poison.<br><br>Not that it would have mattered in Agnes's case. The doctors knew almost nothing about meningitis in those days, except that it was so highly contagious that the law required that the body be placed in a sealed coffin, lined with l...</p><h2>The Air Force Wife Handbook: A Complete Social Guide</h2><p>The Air Force Wife Handbook is written for a very special group of women.

From Sun Valley to Santa Fe, towns throughout the West have been turned over to outsiders&#x2014;and not just to those who visit and move on, but to those who stay and control.<br><br>Although tourism has been a blessing for many, bringing economic and cultural prosperity to communities without obvious means of support or allowing towns on the brink of extinction to renew themselves; the costs on more intangible levels may be said to outweigh the benefits and be a devil's bargain in the making.<br><br>Hal Rothman examines the effect of twentieth-century tourism on the West and exposes that industry's darker side. He tells how tourism evolved from Grand Canyon rail trips to Sun Valley ski weekends and Disneyland vacations, and how the post-World War II boom in air travel and luxury hotels capitalized on a surge in discretionary income for many Americans, combined with newfound leisure time.<br><br>From major destinations like Las Vegas to revitalized towns like Aspen and Moab, Rothman reveals how the introduction of tourism into a community may seem innocuous, but residents gradually realize, as they seek to preserve the authenticity of their communities, that decision-making power has subtly shifted from the community itself to the newly arrived corporate financiers. And because tourism often results in a redistribution of wealth and power to "outsiders," observes Rothman, it represents a new form of colonialism for the region.<br><br>By depicting the nature of tourism in the American West through true stories of places and individuals that have felt its grasp, Rothman doesn't just document the effects of tourism but provides us with an enlightened explanation of the shape these changes take. Deftly balancing historical perspective with an eye for what's happening in the region right now, his book sets new standards for the study of tourism and is one that no citizen of the West whose life is touched by that industry can afford to ignore.</p><p>"Devil's Bargains is a breakthrough book. It becomes the starting point for all future studies of not only tourism but also Western identity and will be integral to discussions on colonialism in the West and Western development. It is valuable for both the range of the material it covers and the depth and nuanced analysis of its case studies, but it does much more than this. It creates a language and a structure for the study of tourism--neonatives, recreational tourism, cultural tourism--that will quickly be adopted by other scholars and structure their analysis. Should appeal to a wide popular audience."--Richard White, author of <i>It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own: A History of the American West</i> <p>"Once pillaged for its raw materials, the American West is now looted for its landscapes and historical auras. Giant resort and gaming corporations are rapidly trans-forming the canonical frontier into a neon theme park, pockmarked with casinos, prisons, trophy homes, and urban slums. Tourism, as Hal Rothman demonstrates in this brilliant and disturbing book, is the price of the land's very soul."--Mike Davis, author of <i>City of Quartz: Excavating the Future of Los Angeles</i></p>Hal K. Rothman is a professor of history at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas and editor of <i>Environmental History</i>. Among his books are <i>The Greening of a Nation?

It is not a theology spun out in a series of principles or axioms of timeless truth that are then applied to the contemporary scene, but a theology springing up out of poverty, the oppression, the heartrending conditions under which the great majority of Latin Americans live.&#34; --- Robert McAfee Brown, from the Preface</p><p>Gustavo Guti rrez, a Dominican theologian from Peru, is widely recognized as one of the preeminent voices of liberation theology.

With one section devoted to desserts using whole vanilla beans&#x2013;think Vanilla Raspberry Rice Pudding with Lemon-Vanilla Caramel and Late-Night Vanilla Flan&#x2013;and another focusing on extract&#x2013;such as Vanilla-Blueberry Crumb Cake and Boston Cream Cupcakes&#x2013;these are recipes that are anything but plain vanilla.<br><br><b>Love Chocolate?</b><br>Say the word chocolate and a chocoholic&#x2019;s face lights up with visions of utterly satisfying, rich pleasures.

She lives in Illinois with her husband and three children. This is her sixth cookbook.<b>Chocolate-Praline Cake in a Jar</b><br> Makes 10 to 12 servings<br><br>For a few years now I've been a judge at the Whirlpool Accubake Unique Cake Contest, which is similar to the Pillsbury Bake-Off. A chocolate cake with a pecan and butterscotch toffee topping called Chocolate Coffee Toffee Cake by Elizabeth Kirsch from Pennsylvania won first place in 2002 and the $10,000 prize, which she donated to Heifer International. Elizabeth told me she made her cakes in glass canning jars and would tuck one into her husband's business trip luggage so he wouldn't miss his favorite cake while he was out of town. This simplified version of her cake would be perfect to take to a picnic or even a backyard barbecue.<br> <br><b>You'll Need</b><br> <br>Ten to twelve 1/2-pint canning jars<br>Rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan<br><b>For The Cake</b><br> <br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br>1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar<br>2 large eggs<br>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>1 1/2 cups sifted cake flour<br>2/3 cup sour cream<br>2/3 cup brewed coffee (I just use the morning&#x2019;s leftover coffee)<br><b>For the Praline Topping</b><br> <br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup water<br> 1 cup powdered sugar<br> 1/2 cup pecan halves or pieces<br>Preheat the oven to 350�F. Place 10 to 12 1/2-pint glass canning jars on a rimmed baking sheet, evenly arranged with space between them. (If you have a Silpat liner, place it under the jars to prevent them from sliding around.)<br> <br>To make the cakes, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter until smooth. Add the brown sugar and eggs and mix until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla, cocoa, baking soda, and salt and mix until combined. Add half of the flour, then half of the sour cream, and mix until combined. Repeat with the remaining flour and sour cream. Drizzle in the coffee and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin, like heavy cream.<br> <br>Pour the batter into the jars, filling them halfway. Bake until the tops of the cakes are firm to the touch, about 25 minutes.*<br> <br>To make the topping, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then add the brown sugar and 1?2 cup water and stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the powdered sugar until combined, then return to the heat and bring to a boil. Stir in the nuts.<br> <br>Pour the praline topping over the cakes to cover, working quickly, because the praline hardens quickly as it cools. Let the cakes cool completely if they aren&#x2019;t already, before screwing on jar lids.**<br><b>Do-Aheads </b><br> <br>*The cakes can be made ahead, cooled, covered, and kept at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.<br>**The finished cakes will keep for up to 4 days at room temperature.<br><b>vanilla charlotte</b><br>Makes one 8-inch charlotte, or 6 to 8 servings<br> <br>No one makes charlottes anymore, which means they're destined for a comeback. A charlotte is a dessert formed in a high, straight-walled mold lined with ladyfingers, cake, or sliced bread and filled with either cooked fruit, such as apples, or a vanilla Bavarian cream like the one I'm using here. Made in one large mold (you can find charlotte molds in good cookware shops), it's a regal-looking dessert that makes an unusual yet light ending for a special occasion.<br> <br><b>You'll Need</b><br> <br> � Charlotte mold, 8-inch springfoam pan, or souffle dish <br> � Parchment paper <br> � Instant-read thermometer, optional<br><b>Ingredients </b><br> <br> � 1 (7-ounce) package store-bought ladyfingers <br> � 2 (1/2 pint) containers raspberries <br> � 4 cups whole milk <br> � 1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise <br> � 1 tablespoon powdered gelatin <br> � 2 tablespoons cold water <br> � 12 large egg yolks <br> � 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar <br> � White chocolate curls (see below) <br> � Powdered sugar<br>If you have a charlotte mold you do not need to line it. Otherwise, line an 8-inch springform pan or souffle dish with parchment paper using a circle for the bottom and a strip 4 inches wide around the sides. Dab a little softened butter or a spritz of nonstick cooking spray in the pan to anchor the paper. Generously spray or grease the parchment or charlotte mold. Stand the ladyfingers up around the insides of the pan.<br> <br>Pick over the raspberries, setting aside the best ones, a little less than 1/2 pint, to make a circle around the edge of the finished charlotte.<br> <br>Have ready near your cooktop a large bowl. Fill the bowl three-quarters full with ice and cover the ice with water.<br> <br>Bring the milk and vanilla bean to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. As soon as it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and let the vanilla steep in the milk for 10 minutes.<br> <br>Gradually sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a small bowl and set aside for the gelatin to soften.<br> <br>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the granulated sugar for about 1 minute to combine and then gradually pour in the hot milk, whisking continuously. Return the mixture to the saucepan and, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook over medium heat until the sauce has thickened and is 180�F on an instant-read thermometer, being careful not to overcook it or it will break. (If you don't have a thermometer, test the mixture by dipping a wooden spoon into it, and then running your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains intact, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not cooked enough yet.)<br> <br>Immediately stir the softened gelatin into the custard until it's dissolved and then strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Put the bowl of custard into the bowl of ice water and stir frequently until the custard starts to cool and thicken.<br> <br>Fold in the less-than-perfect berries (don't worry if the berries break up a bit) and then pour the custard into the pan lined with the ladyfingers. Spread the top of the custard to smooth it. Cover the charlotte with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours.*<br> <br>To serve, trim the ladyfingers even with the top of the custard. Put a serving platter upside down over the pan and quickly invert it. Remove the mold and parchment. Arrange the reserved raspberries around the edge of the charlotte and pile white chocolate curls in the center. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into wedges for serving.<br> <br><b>Making Chocolate Curls</b><br> To make beautiful chocolate curls for decorating desserts, the two keys are to use a block of chocolate and have it at barely above room temperature. If it's too cold it will break into shards as you peel it. At the restaurant we leave the chocolate block near or over a warm oven. At home you could warm it with a hair dryer set on low, or try wrapping it in a tea towel and warming it with the heat of your hands. Use a vegetable peeler and pull across the side of the block so the chocolate comes off in curls. Place them on a plate and refrigerate until you need them.<br> <br><b>Do-Ahead</b><br> * The charlotte will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Sweden (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Sweden</i></b> will lead you straight to the best attractions this breathtaking country has to offer.</p><p>Explore this beautiful Scandinavian country region-by-region, from local festivals and markets to day trips around the countryside.
